Micron And Intel Create New Company To Manufacture NAND Flash Memory

BOISE, Idaho, and SANTA CLARA, Calif., Nov. 21, 2005 - Micron
Technology, Inc., and Intel Corporation today announced they have
agreed to form a new company to manufacture NAND flash memory for use
in consumer electronics, removable storage and handheld communications
devices. The new company will exclusively manufacture product for
Micron and Intel. Formation of the company is subject to customary
closing conditions and is expected to be finalized around the end of
the year.

The company, to be called IM Flash Technologies, LLC, brings together
the manufacturing technology, assets, experience and scale necessary
for Intel and Micron to successfully compete in the NAND flash memory
business, an increasingly important and fast-growing market segment.
The new company combines Micron's expertise in developing NAND
technology and operating highly efficient manufacturing facilities with
Intel's multi-level cell technology and history of innovation in the
flash memory business.

In addition and subject to the closing of the venture, Intel and Micron
have each entered into separate long-term agreements to supply Apple
with a significant portion of each of their share of IM Flash
Technologies' NAND flash memory output. As part of these agreements,
Apple would prepay $250 million each to Intel and Micron.

"This strategic relationship positions both Intel and Micron to build
on each other's strengths to become leaders in the fast-growing NAND
market segment," said Steve Appleton, Micron chairman, president and
CEO. "This enhances Micron's competitive position as a leading supplier
of advanced semiconductor solutions by ensuring we better serve our
customers in the mobile communication and consumer electronics market
segments."

"The creation of this new company supports Intel's intent to maintain
its industry-leading position in nonvolatile memory and enables us to
rapidly enter a fast-growing portion of the flash market segment," said
Paul Otellini, Intel president and CEO. "We are looking forward to
working with Micron, and are extremely pleased to have Apple broaden
its relationship with us."

Intel and Micron have agreed to initially contribute approximately $1.2
billion each in cash, notes and assets to IM Flash Technologies.
Subject to certain conditions, the parties will each contribute an
additional approximately $1.4 billion over the next three years and
intend to make additional investments as appropriate to support the
growth of the operation. The company will be 51 percent owned by Micron
and 49 percent owned by Intel. Production will initially take place in
manufacturing facilities located in Boise, Idaho, Manassas, Va. and
Lehi, Utah. The new company will benefit from Micron's and Intel's
process technology expertise to aggressively convert to advanced 72nm
and 50nm technology. Initial production from the company is expected in
early 2006.

The management team for the new company will be led by Intel's Dave
Baglee, who previously served as manager of Intel's Fab 11 in New
Mexico, and Micron's Rod Morgan, who most recently served as manager of
Micron's fabrication facility in Manassas.

Micron Technology, Inc. is one of the world's leading providers of
advanced semiconductor solutions. Through its worldwide operations,
Micron manufactures and markets DRAMs, NAND Flash memory, CMOS image
sensors, other semiconductor components, and memory modules for use in
leading-edge computing, consumer, networking, and mobile products.
Micron's common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
under the MU symbol. To learn more about Micron Technology, Inc., visit
its Web site at www.micron.com.

Intel, the world's largest chip maker, is also a leading manufacturer
of computer, networking and communications products. Additional
information about Intel is available at www.intel.com/pressroom.

This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding future
investments by Micron and Intel in IM Flash Technologies ("IMFT") and
the timing of and technology used in future production from IMFT.
Although Micron and Intel believe that the expectations reflected in
the forward-looking statements are reasonable, Micron and Intel cannot
guarantee their or IMFT's respective future results, levels of activity,
performance or achievements. Actual events or results may differ
materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements.
Among the important factors that could cause actual results to vary are
changes in Micron's and Intel's ability and commitment to contribute
cash or assets to IMFT; the demand for and market acceptance of
products Micron and Intel have manufactured by and purchase from IMFT,
including the level of sales under Micron's and Intel's supply
agreements with Apple; pricing pressures and actions taken by
competitors; the timing and execution of the manufacturing ramp, and
manufacturing yields, at IMFT's production facilities; disruptions in
IMFT's supply of necessary raw materials, utilities or other
infrastructure; unexpected expenses related to IMFT's operations; the
ability of Intel and Micron to integrate technology, management and
operations at IMFT and at the facilities that it uses; adverse effects
associated with product defects and errata (deviations from published
specifications); and litigation or regulatory matters involving
intellectual property, antitrust and other issues. These factors could
materially affect the results of IMFT that will be reflected in
Micron's and Intel's respective financial statements. In addition,
please refer to the documents that Micron and Intel file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. The
filings by each of Micron and Intel identify and address other
important factors that could cause their respective relationship with
IMFT and their respective financial and operational results to differ
materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements set
forth in this press release and in the companies' respective filings.
Micron and Intel are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking
statements after the date of this press release to conform to actual
results.
