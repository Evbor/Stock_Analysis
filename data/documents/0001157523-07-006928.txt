   Financial and Key Product Trends

   --  Second-quarter gross margin was 46.9 percent, lower than the
        midpoint of the previous expectation. Microprocessor margins
        were as expected with higher unit shipments offset by lower
        average selling prices (ASPs). Demand for NOR flash products
        was lower than expected, resulting in impacts that lowered
        Intel's gross margin by one point.

   --  Total microprocessor units were higher sequentially; the ASP
        was lower.

   --  Chipset units set a record during the quarter.

   --  Flash memory units were higher sequentially while motherboard
        units were lower.

   Business Outlook

   The following expectations do not include the potential impact of
any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other business combinations
that may be completed after July 16.

   Q3 2007 Outlook

   --  Revenue: Between $9.0 billion and $9.6 billion.

   --  Gross margin: 52 percent plus or minus a couple of points.

   --  Spending (R&D plus MG&A): Between $2.7 billion and $2.8
        billion.

   --  Restructuring and asset impairment charges: Approximately $150
        million.

   --  Net gains from equity investments and interest and other:
        Approximately $320 million.

   --  Tax rate: Approximately 29 percent, lower than the previous
        expectation of approximately 31 percent.

   --  Depreciation: Approximately $1.1 billion.

   2007 Outlook

   --  Gross margin: 51 percent plus or minus a few points,
        unchanged.

   --  R&D: Approximately $5.7 billion, higher than the previous
        expectation of approximately $5.6 billion.

   --  MG&A: Approximately $5.1 billion, unchanged.

   --  Capital spending: $4.9 billion plus or minus $200 million,
        lower than the previous expectation of $5.5 billion plus or
        minus $200 million, primarily due to manufacturing
        efficiencies.

   --  Tax rate: Approximately 29 percent in the fourth quarter,
        lower than the previous expectation of approximately 31
        percent.

   --  Depreciation: $4.6 billion plus or minus $100 million, lower
        than the previous expectation of $4.8 billion plus or minus
        $100 million due to suspended depreciation for NOR flash
        manufacturing assets that are being held for sale.

   The above statements and any others in this document that refer to
plans and expectations for the third quarter, the year and the future
are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and
uncertainties. Many factors could affect Intel's actual results, and
variances from Intel's current expectations regarding such factors
could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed
in these forward-looking statements. Intel presently considers the
factors set forth below in the section titled "Risk Factors" to be the
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from the corporation's published expectations.

   Recent Events

   --  Intel, STMicroelectronics and Francisco Partners announced an
        agreement to form a new independent company by combining
        Intel's NOR flash memory business and STMicroelectronics' NOR
        and NAND flash businesses. The new company is expected to be a
        market segment leader in non-volatile memory solutions,
        serving customers in wireless communications and other
        segments. The transaction is expected to close by the fourth
        quarter of 2007 upon satisfaction of regulatory reviews and
        closing conditions.

   --  Intel introduced a new generation of Intel(R) Centrino(R)
        processor technology (formerly codenamed Santa Rosa) that
        delivers faster Intel(R) Core(TM) 2 Duo processors,
        high-bandwidth 802.11n WiFi connectivity, richer graphics
        processing and optional Intel(R) Turbo Memory. Notebook PC
        makers are launching more than 230 new designs for consumers
        and business users.

   --  The company launched the first-ever Intel(R) Core(TM) 2
        Extreme processors for mobile, enabling notebook PCs for the
        most demanding gamers, digital artists and media enthusiasts.

   --  Intel introduced the Intel(R) 3 Series chipset family which
        brings new capabilities to today's systems and provides
        manufacturers with a socket-compatible migration path to
        Intel's upcoming "Penryn" family of processors based on the
        industry's first 45nm logic process technology.

   --  The company announced it has shipped over 1 million quad-core
        microprocessors for servers and enthusiast desktop systems,
        expanding its quad-core line-up to 14 different processors.

   --  Intel and the One Laptop Per Child association announced plans
        to collaborate on education-related technology targeting the
        more than 1 billion K-12 students worldwide who will benefit
        from access to PCs and the Internet.

   --  Intel and Micron Technology announced customer sampling of 16
        Gbit NAND flash memories that will use 50nm lithography and
        multi-level cell technology to deliver four times the storage
        capacity of the companies' existing products.

   Risk Factors

   --  Intel operates in intensely competitive industries that are
        characterized by a high percentage of costs that are fixed or
        difficult to reduce in the short term, significant pricing
        pressures, and product demand that is highly variable and
        difficult to forecast. Additionally, Intel is in the process
        of transitioning to its next generation of products on 45nm
        process technology, and there could be execution issues
        associated with these changes, including product defects and
        errata along with lower than anticipated manufacturing yields.
        Revenue and the gross margin percentage are affected by the
        timing of new Intel product introductions and the demand for
        and market acceptance of Intel's products; actions taken by
        Intel's competitors, including product offerings and
        introductions, marketing programs and pricing pressures and
        Intel's response to such actions; Intel's ability to respond
        quickly to technological developments and to incorporate new
        features into its products; and the availability of sufficient
        components from suppliers to meet demand. Factors that could
        cause demand to be different from Intel's expectations include
        customer acceptance of Intel's and competitors' products;
        changes in customer order patterns, including order
        cancellations; changes in the level of inventory at customers;
        and changes in business and economic conditions.

   --  The gross margin percentage could vary significantly from
        expectations based on changes in revenue levels; product mix
        and pricing; capacity utilization; variations in inventory
        valuation, including variations related to the timing of
        qualifying products for sale; excess or obsolete inventory;
        manufacturing yields; changes in unit costs; impairments of
        long-lived assets, including manufacturing, assembly/test and
        intangible assets; and the timing and execution of the
        manufacturing ramp and associated costs, including start-up
        costs.

   --  Expenses, particularly certain marketing and compensation
        expenses, vary depending on the level of demand for Intel's
        products, the level of revenue and profits, and impairments of
        long-lived assets.

   --  Intel is in the midst of a structure and efficiency program
        that is resulting in several actions that could have an impact
        on expected expense levels and gross margin.

   --  The tax rate expectation is based on current tax law and
        current expected income. The tax rate may be affected by the
        closing of acquisitions or divestitures; changes in the
        estimates of credits, benefits and deductions; the resolution
        of issues arising from tax audits with various tax
        authorities, including payment of interest and penalties; and
        the ability to realize deferred tax assets.

   --  Gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other
        could vary from expectations depending on equity market levels
        and volatility; gains or losses realized on the sale or
        exchange of securities; gains or losses from equity method
        investments; impairment charges related to marketable,
        non-marketable and other investments; interest rates; cash
        balances; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments.

   --  Intel's results could be affected by the amount, type, and
        valuation of share-based awards granted as well as the amount
        of awards cancelled due to employee turnover and the timing of
        award exercises by employees.

   --  Intel's results could be impacted by unexpected economic,
        social, political and physical/infrastructure conditions in
        the countries in which Intel, its customers or its suppliers
        operate, including military conflict and other security risks,
        natural disasters, infrastructure disruptions, health concerns
        and fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

   --  Intel's results could be affected by adverse effects
        associated with product defects and errata (deviations from
        published specifications), and by litigation or regulatory
        matters involving intellectual property, stockholder,
        consumer, antitrust and other issues, such as the litigation
        and regulatory matters described in Intel's SEC reports.

   A detailed discussion of these and other factors that could affect
Intel's results is included in Intel's SEC filings, including the
report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2007.

   Status of Business Outlook

   During the quarter, Intel's corporate representatives may
reiterate the Business Outlook during private meetings with investors,
investment analysts, the media and others. From the close of business
on Sept. 14 until publication of the company's third-quarter 2007
earnings release, Intel will observe a "Quiet Period" during which the
Business Outlook disclosed in the company's press releases and filings
with the SEC should be considered to be historical, speaking as of
prior to the Quiet Period only and not subject to update by the
company.

   Earnings Webcast

   Intel will hold a public webcast at 2:30 p.m. PDT today on its
Investor Relations Web site at intc.com. A webcast replay and MP3
audio download will also be made available on the site.

Our operating segments include the Digital Enterprise Group, Mobility
 Group, Flash Memory Group, Digital Home Group, and Digital Health
 Group. The Digital Home Group and Digital Health Group operating
 segments are included within the "all other" category. In the first
 quarter of 2007, the Channel Platforms Group began directly
 supporting our operating segments. We adjusted prior-period amounts
 to reflect certain minor reorganizations. In the second quarter of
 2007, we agreed to sell certain NOR assets related to our Flash
 Memory Group operating segment to a new flash memory company that we
 plan to form with STMicroelectronics N.V. and Francisco Partners L.P.

We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, finance, and
 administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally
 allocated to the operating segments and the expenses are included in
 the operating results reported above. Additionally, in the first
 quarter of 2007, we began allocating share-based compensation to the
 operating segments and adjusted results to reflect this change.
 Revenue for the "all other" category primarily relates to
 microprocessors and related chipsets sold by the Digital Home Group.
 The "all other" category also includes certain corporate-level
 operating expenses and charges. These expenses/charges include:
    -- a portion of profit-dependent bonus and other expenses not
     allocated to the operating segments;

    -- results of operations of seed businesses that support our
     initiatives;

    -- acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any
     impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill;

    -- charges for purchased in-process research and development; and

    -- amounts included within restructuring and asset impairment
     charges on the consolidated summary income statement data.
