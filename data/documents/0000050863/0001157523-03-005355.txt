                                                                Exhibit 99.1

                Intel Announces Third-Quarter Revenue
              of $7.8 Billion, Earnings Per Share $0.25

    SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 14, 2003--Intel
Corporation today announced third-quarter revenue of $7.8 billion, up
15 percent sequentially and up 20 percent year-over-year.
    Third-quarter net income was $1.7 billion, up 85 percent
sequentially and up 142 percent year-over-year. Earnings per share
were $0.25, up 79 percent sequentially and up 150 percent from $0.10
in the third quarter of 2002.
    "Intel delivered excellent results in the quarter led by global
strength in our computing-related business, resulting in record unit
shipments of microprocessors and chipsets," said Craig R. Barrett,
Intel chief executive officer. "Our resolve to invest aggressively
during the downturn is paying off with double-digit revenue growth and
a doubling of profit compared to a year ago.
    "Our product and technology leadership make us well positioned to
take advantage of improving demand. Going forward, our strategy
remains the same: Invest in leading-edge capacity, develop innovative
new products, and target growth opportunities worldwide."

    BUSINESS OUTLOOK

    The following statements are based on current expectations. These
statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ
materially. These statements do not include the potential impact of
any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other business combinations
that may be completed after Oct. 13, 2003.
    Continuing uncertainty in global economic conditions makes it
particularly difficult to predict product demand and other related
matters.

    --  Revenue in the fourth quarter is expected to be between $8.1
        billion and $8.7 billion.

    --  Gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter is expected to
        be approximately 60 percent, plus or minus a couple of points,
        as compared to 58.2 percent in the third quarter, primarily
        due to higher revenue. Intel's gross margin percentage varies
        primarily with revenue levels, product mix and pricing,
        changes in unit costs and inventory valuation, capacity
        utilization, and the timing of factory ramps and associated
        costs.

    --  The R&D spending expectation for 2003 is $4.3 billion, as
        compared to the previous expectation of $4.2 billion.

    --  Expenses (R&D plus MG&A) in the fourth quarter are expected to
        be between $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion. Expenses,
        particularly certain marketing- and compensation-related
        expenses, vary depending on the level of revenue and profits.

    --  Capital spending for 2003 is expected to be between $3.6
        billion and $3.7 billion, as compared to the previous
        expectation of $3.5 billion to $3.9 billion.

    --  Gains or losses from equity investments and interest and other
        in the fourth quarter is expected to be zero due to the
        expectation of a net loss on equity investments of
        approximately $35 million, primarily as a result of impairment
        charges.

    --  The tax rate for the fourth quarter is expected to be
        approximately 31.5 percent. The increase versus the previous
        expectation of 30.5 percent is primarily driven by higher
        expected profits for the year with a higher percentage of
        profits expected in high-tax jurisdictions. The tax rate
        expectation is based on current tax law and current expected
        income, and assumes Intel continues to receive tax benefits
        for export sales. The tax rate may be affected by the closing
        of acquisitions or divestitures, the jurisdiction in which
        profits are determined to be earned and taxed, and the ability
        to realize deferred tax assets.

    --  Depreciation for the fourth quarter is expected to be
        approximately $1.2 billion.

    --  Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs is
        expected to be approximately $65 million in the fourth
        quarter.

    The statements in this document that refer to plans and
expectations for the fourth quarter, the year and the future are
forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and
uncertainties. A number of factors in addition to those discussed
above could cause actual results to differ materially from
expectations. Demand for Intel's products, which impacts revenue and
the gross margin percentage, is affected by business and economic
conditions, as well as computing and communications industry trends,
and changes in customer order patterns. Intel conducts much of its
manufacturing, assembly and test, and sales activities outside the
United States and is thus subject to a number of other factors,
including currency controls and fluctuations, tariff and import
regulations, and regulatory requirements which may limit our or our
customers' ability to manufacture or sell products in particular
countries. If terrorist activity, armed conflict, civil or military
unrest or political instability occurs in the United States, Israel or
other locations, such events may disrupt manufacturing, assembly and
test, logistics, security and communications, and could also result in
reduced demand for Intel's products. The impacts of major health
concerns, such as the SARS illness, or of large-scale outages or
interruptions of service from utility or other infrastructure
providers, on Intel, its suppliers, customers or other third parties
could also adversely affect our business and impact our customer order
patterns. Revenue and the gross margin percentage are affected by
competing chip architectures and manufacturing technologies, competing
software-compatible microprocessors, pricing pressures and other
competitive factors, as well as market acceptance of Intel's new
products, availability of sufficient inventory to meet demand,
availability of externally purchased components, and development and
timing of compelling software applications and operating systems that
take advantage of the features of our products. Future revenue is also
dependent on continuing technological advancement, including
developing and implementing new processes and strategic products, as
well as the timing of new product introductions, sustaining and
growing new businesses and integrating and operating any acquired
businesses. The gross margin percentage could also be affected by the
execution of the manufacturing ramp, excess manufacturing capacity,
excess or obsolete inventory, variations in inventory valuation and
impairment of manufacturing assets. The expectation regarding gains or
losses from equity securities and interest and other assumes no
unanticipated events and varies depending on equity market levels and
volatility, gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of
securities, impairment charges related to non-marketable and other
investments, interest rates, cash balances, and changes in fair value
of derivative instruments. Expectations of impairment charges on
investments are based on experience, and it is not possible to know
which specific investments are likely to be impaired or the extent or
timing of individual impairments. Results could also be affected by
adverse effects associated with product defects and errata (deviations
from published specifications), and by litigation, such as that
described in Intel's SEC reports, as well as other risk factors listed
in Intel's SEC reports, including the report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended June 28, 2003.

    Status of Business Outlook and Mid-Quarter Business Update

    During the quarter, Intel's corporate representatives may
reiterate the Business Outlook during private meetings with investors,
investment analysts, the media and others. Intel intends to publish a
Mid-Quarter Business Update on Dec. 4. From the close of business on
Nov. 26 until publication of the Update, Intel will observe a "Quiet
Period" during which the Outlook and the company's filings with the
SEC on Forms 10-K and 10-Q should be considered to be historical,
speaking as of prior to the Quiet Period only and not subject to
update by the company. For more information about the Outlook, Update
and related Quiet Periods, please refer to the Outlook section of the
Web site at www.intc.com.

    THIRD-QUARTER REVIEW AND RECENT HIGHLIGHTS

    Financial Review

    --  Gains or losses on equity investments and interest and other
        resulted in a net loss of $29 million, as compared to the
        expectation of a net loss of $25 million. The net loss on
        equity investments was $63 million, including the impact of
        impairment charges of approximately $92 million.

    --  The tax rate for the third quarter was 27 percent, lower than
        the company's revised expectation of approximately 28 percent,
        primarily because a tax benefit related to a divestiture that
        closed during the quarter was slightly larger than expected.

    --  During the quarter, the company did not repurchase shares
        under its ongoing stock repurchase program. As of the end of
        the third quarter, the company is authorized to repurchase an
        additional 475 million shares under the program.

    Key Product Trends (Sequential)

    --  Intel Architecture microprocessor units set a record. The
        average selling price was slightly higher.

    --  Chipset units set a record.

    --  Motherboard units set a record.

    --  Flash memory units were slightly higher.

    --  Ethernet connectivity product units were higher.
