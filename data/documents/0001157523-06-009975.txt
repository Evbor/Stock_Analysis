       Item 2.02     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                     Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by
                     reference herein is financial information for Intel
                     Corporation for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 and
                     forward-looking statements relating to 2006 and the fourth
                     quarter of 2006 as presented in a press release of October
                     17, 2006. The information in this report shall be deemed
                     incorporated by reference into any registration statement
                     heretofore or hereafter filed under the Securities Act of
                     1933, as amended, except to the extent that such
                     information is superseded by information as of a subsequent
                     date that is included in or incorporated by reference into
                     such registration statement. The information in this report
                     shall not be treated as filed for purposes of the
                     Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

                     In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in
                     accordance with United States (U.S.) generally accepted
                     accounting principles (GAAP), the company's earnings
                     release contains non-GAAP financial measures that exclude
                     the effects of share-based compensation and the
                     requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
                     No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" (SFAS No.
                     123(R)). The non-GAAP financial measures used by management
                     and disclosed by the company exclude the income statement
                     effects of all forms of share-based compensation and the
                     effects of SFAS No. 123(R) upon the number of diluted
                     common shares used in calculating non-GAAP diluted earnings
                     per share. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the
                     company should not be considered a substitute for, or
                     superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance
                     with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in
                     accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial
                     statements should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP
                     financial measures used by the company may be calculated
                     differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to,
                     similarly titled measures used by other companies. The
                     company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP
                     financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP
                     financial measures. The company applied the modified
                     prospective method of adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), under
                     which the effects of SFAS No. 123(R) are reflected in the
                     company's GAAP financial statement presentations for and
                     after the first quarter 2006, but are not reflected in
                     results for prior periods.

                     In managing the company's business on a consolidated basis,
                     consistent with how we managed the business prior to the
                     adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), management develops an annual
                     budget that includes all components of the income
                     statement, exclusive of share-based compensation. Gross
                     margin, expenses (research and development and marketing,
                     general and administrative), operating income, income
                     taxes, net income and diluted earnings per share (EPS) are
                     the primary consolidated financial measures management uses
                     for planning and forecasting future periods that are
                     affected by share-based compensation. The company's budget
                     and planning process commences with a segment-level
                     evaluation which excludes share-based compensation, and
                     culminates with the preparation of a consolidated annual
                     and/or quarterly budget that includes these non-GAAP
                     financial measures. This budget, once finalized and
                     approved, serves as the basis for the allocation of
                     resources and management of operations. The number of
                     full-time equivalent employees working in manufacturing,
                     research and development, and marketing, general and
                     administrative related roles is determined through the
                     budgeting process exclusive of share-based compensation.
                     Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based
                     compensation charges and therefore the budget and planning
                     process, which involves headcount planning, excludes the

                                       2
<PAGE>

                     effects of share-based compensation. In addition, our tax
                     strategies are determined on a consolidated basis exclusive
                     of the expenses and related tax benefit relating to
                     share-based compensation. The accounting expense impact of
                     share-based compensation is not discussed nor considered
                     when assessing and determining the appropriate level of
                     budgeted expenses for gross margin, research and
                     development, and marketing, general and administrative
                     expenses. Accordingly, such amounts are also excluded from
                     the budgeted operating income, net income, and earnings per
                     share. GAAP-basis financial statements which include the
                     effects of share-based compensation are only reviewed and
                     analyzed for purposes of external reporting where
                     GAAP-basis financial statements are necessary.

                     Under our budget and planning process, consistent with our
                     practice prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), when we
                     seek to reduce unit costs with the goal of increasing gross
                     margin, management does not consider the effects of
                     share-based compensation. When assessing the level of
                     research and development efforts currently or
                     prospectively, consistent with our practice prior to the
                     adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), management does not consider
                     the effects of share-based compensation. When making
                     decisions about project spending, administrative budgets,
                     or marketing programs, management does not consider the
                     effects of share-based compensation.

                     In addition to using the budget process for planning and
                     resource allocation, on a quarterly basis we analyze the
                     performance of our business on a consolidated basis by
                     comparing our gross margin, expenses (research and
                     development and marketing, general and administrative),
                     operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per
                     share, each excluding share-based compensation, to the
                     prior period and forecasted amounts developed during the
                     budget and planning process, also excluding share-based
                     compensation. We use these quarterly assessments to
                     evaluate the performance of the business against prior
                     periods and budget and to develop our business outlook
                     which we communicate to investors.

                     Consistent with our practice prior to the adoption of SFAS
                     No. 123(R), the company's share-based compensation programs
                     are established and managed on a company-wide basis,
                     including specification of grant types and amount ranges
                     for employees by category and grade. Our philosophy
                     relative to share-based compensation programs is built on
                     the principle that equity compensation should seek to align
                     employees' actions and behaviors with stockholders'
                     interest; be market competitive; be able to attract,
                     motivate and retain the best employees; and support Intel's
                     belief in a broad-based approach. Share based compensation
                     granted to employees is in addition to, not in lieu of,
                     cash compensation. Accordingly, our share-based
                     compensation programs are evaluated separately from the
                     cost of our other compensation programs. Specifically, our
                     share-based compensation programs are carefully evaluated
                     from the perspective of the resulting dilution and other
                     metrics, and not from the resulting expense to be recorded.
                     For example, our goal has been to keep the potential
                     incremental dilution related to our equity incentive plans
                     (stock options and restricted stock units) to a long-term
                     average of less than 2% annually. The dilution percentage
                     is calculated using the new equity-based awards, net of
                     equity-based awards cancelled due to employees leaving the
                     company and expired stock options, divided by the total
                     outstanding shares at the beginning of the year. Further,
                     as noted above, segment managers are not held accountable
                     for share-based compensation charges, and these charges do
                     not impact their business unit's operating income (loss).
                     Accordingly, share-based compensation charges also are
                     excluded from the company's measure of segment
                     profitability (operating income). Therefore, when
                     evaluating segment and operating income, management and the
                     Board of Directors exclude share-based compensation.

                     Operating income and net income, both on a per-share basis,
                     are calculated excluding share-based compensation for
                     purposes of evaluating profit-dependent cash incentive
                     compensation paid to employees, including senior
                     management. For example, for 2006, the executive
                     compensation cash incentive plan formula measures EPS as
                     the greater of (a) Intel's operating income or (b) Intel's
                     net income (in both cases excluding the effect of
                     share-based compensation), divided by Intel's weighted
                     average diluted common shares outstanding, excluding the
                     effects of share-based compensation. The calculation of
                     diluted common shares outstanding, excluding the effects of
                     share-based compensation, excludes the proceeds from the
                     remaining unamortized share-based compensation, and adjusts
                     the proceeds from tax benefits by excluding the effects of
                     share-based compensation. The calculation of diluted common
                     shares outstanding, excluding the effects of share-based
                     compensation is similar to the calculation of diluted
                     common shares outstanding, as reported, prior to the
                     adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). Accordingly, when budgeting
                     for the company's profit-dependent cash incentives, the
                     company applies the formula above to calculate earnings per
                     share excluding share-based compensation so as to be able
                     to factor the appropriate amount of profit dependent cash
                     incentive into the budget.

                     The company discloses this non-GAAP information to the
                     public to enable investors to more easily assess the
                     company's performance on the same basis applied by
                     management and to ease comparison on both a GAAP and
                     non-GAAP basis to our prior period results. In particular,
                     as the company begins to apply SFAS No. 123(R), the company
                     believes that it is useful to investors to understand how
                     the expenses and other adjustments associated with the
                     application of SFAS No. 123(R) are being reflected on the
                     company's income statements. Management believes gross
                     margin, excluding share-based compensation, research and
                     development, excluding share-based compensation, and
                     marketing, general, and administrative expense, excluding
                     share-based compensation, are useful information for
                     investors because the GAAP measure when compared in
                     isolation with 2005 would indicate a level of increase in
                     those expenses inconsistent with actual performance. We
                     believe that the non-GAAP measures serve to provide a
                     baseline for investors in this first year of adoption to
                     compare actual results for the current year, excluding
                     share-based compensation to the prior year GAAP amounts
                     which exclude share-based compensation. We believe this
                     comparison also is useful to allow investors to more easily
                     evaluate our results from a period-to-period comparability
                     perspective.

                     Management believes operating income and net income,
                     excluding share-based compensation, is useful information
                     to investors because it assists investors in evaluating
                     operating income and net income consistent with how
                     management evaluates performance and to understand the
                     basis for the company's profit dependent cash incentive
                     plan. Especially in this first year of applying the
                     provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), we believe operating and net
                     income as reported in our income statement are not
                     comparable to prior year period amounts, and may lead
                     investors to believe business has declined more
                     significantly than would be caused by actual changes in the
                     business (as opposed to changes in accounting treatment
                     between years). When presenting net income, excluding
                     share-based compensation, we believe it appropriate to
                     exclude the related tax benefit recognized in the financial
                     statements for purposes of presenting net income or EPS,
                     excluding share-based compensation. Providing diluted
                     earnings per share, excluding share-based compensation
                     assists investors in evaluating diluted earnings per share
                     compared to prior periods. Especially in this first year of
                     applying the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), we believe
                     diluted earnings per share as reported in our income
                     statement is not comparable to prior year amounts.

                     The basis for the company's decision to use these non-GAAP
                     measures excluding share-based compensation is that
                     management has determined in this first year of adoption of
                     SFAS No. 123(R) to continue to evaluate the business on the
                     same basis as prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)
                     until there is greater familiarity with its effects and
                     until the second year after adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)
                     when financial information is prepared and presented on a
                     consistent basis with the prior year. Share-based
                     compensation represents: 1.2 points of gross margin, $107
                     million of research and development expenses, $125 million
                     of marketing, general and administrative expenses, $335
                     million reduction in total operating income, $248 million
                     reduction in total net income, and a $0.05 reduction in
                     diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended September
                     30, 2006, compared to zero for all such measures in the
                     quarter ended October 1, 2005. Share-based compensation
                     represents: 0.8 points of gross margin, $126 million of
                     research and development expenses, $140 million of
                     marketing, general and administrative expenses, $332
                     million reduction in total operating income, $239 million
                     reduction in total net income, and a $0.04 reduction in
                     diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended July 1,
                     2006.

                     Unlike other forms of compensation, share-based
                     compensation was not recognized prior to January 1, 2006
                     when we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R).
                     Additionally, when management determines the annual merit
                     and promotional budget for compensation, the effects of
                     share-based compensation on the company's financial
                     statements are not considered. Rather share-based awards
                     are generally granted via a fixed formula depending on
                     position and level of the employee. In addition, segment
                     managers are held accountable for other forms of
                     compensation, and as such those compensation charges are
                     included in the segments' results and in the budget and
                     planning processes of our reporting segments.

                     A material limitation associated with the use of these
                     measures as compared to the related GAAP measures is that
                     they may reduce comparability with other companies who may
                     use different types of equity incentive awards, or whose
                     compensation structures may use share-based compensation to
                     a greater or lesser extent as part of their overall
                     compensation. These differences may cause our non-GAAP
                     measures excluding share-based compensation to not be
                     comparable to other companies' non-GAAP measures excluding
                     share-based compensation. Other material limitations
                     associated with the use of these measures as compared to
                     the GAAP comparable measure include: gross margin,
                     excluding share-based compensation, does not include all
                     costs related to the cost of inventory sold during the
                     period; research and development, excluding share-based
                     compensation, does not include all costs related to the
                     research and development needed to bring new products to
                     the market; marketing, general and administrative expenses
                     excluding share-based compensation, does not include all
                     costs related to the marketing, general and administrative
                     efforts required to manage our company and sell our
                     products. A material limitation with using operating
                     income, excluding share-based compensation, net income,
                     excluding share-based compensation, and diluted earnings
                     per share, excluding share-based compensation, is that they
                     do not include all costs typically included in the
                     presentation of the comparable GAAP measure, and they may
                     not include all costs related to hiring and retaining
                     qualified employees.

                     Although these non-GAAP financial measures adjust cost,
                     expenses and diluted share items to exclude the accounting
                     treatment of share-based compensation, they should not be
                     viewed as a pro forma presentation reflecting the
                     elimination of the underlying share-based compensation
                     programs. Thus, our non-GAAP presentations are not intended
                     to present, and should not be used, as a basis for
                     assessing what our operating results might be if we were to
                     eliminate our share-based compensation programs. Our equity
                     incentive plans are an important element of the company's
                     compensation structure and GAAP indicates that all forms of
                     share-based payments should be valued and included as
                     appropriate in results of operations.

                     Because of the foregoing limitations, management does not
                     intend to use the non-GAAP financial measures when
                     assessing the company's performance against that of other
                     companies. The company manages its share-based compensation
                     plans in the aggregate against certain metrics rather than
                     reviewing financial statement impacts by financial
                     statement line item. Specifically, our goal has been to
                     keep the potential incremental dilution related to our
                     equity incentive plans (stock options and restricted stock
                     units) to a long-term average of less than 2% annually. The
                     dilution percentage is calculated using the new
                     equity-based awards, net of equity-based awards cancelled
                     due to employees leaving the company and expired stock
                     options, divided by the total outstanding shares at the
                     beginning of the year.

       Item 7.01     Regulation FD Disclosure.

                     In connection with the company's ongoing program designed
                     to improve operational efficiency and results, the company
                     previously announced that it had determined on August 30,
                     2006 to undertake a number of additional actions
                     recommended by the company's Structure and Efficiency
                     Taskforce relating to organizational efficiency, business
                     processes and programs (collectively, the "Efficiency
                     Plan").

                     The company's workforce on July 1, 2006, before these
                     additional actions began, was 102,500 persons, and on
                     September 30, 2006, was 99,900 persons. Year-end 2006
                     employment is expected to be approximately 95,000 persons
                     and thereafter to continue to be reduced to approximately
                     92,000 by the middle of 2007.

                     In connection with the Efficiency Plan, the company
                     recorded restructuring charges of $98 million in the third
                     quarter of 2006 and expects to record approximately $125
                     million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of
                     2006, in each case relating to severance and employee
                     benefit charges. The company currently expects to incur
                     additional charges related to employee severance and
                     benefit arrangements of approximately $120 million in 2007.
                     Additional, presently undetermined, charges may be incurred
                     in the 2007, 2008 and 2009 fiscal years. Additional details
                     will be provided in the company's earnings releases and
                     Business Outlook statements published quarterly in such
                     fiscal years.

                     The exact timing of these charges and the related cash
                     outflows, as well as the estimated cost ranges by category
                     type, have not been finalized. This information will be
                     subject to the finalization of timetables for the
                     transition of functions, local labor law requirements,
                     including consultation with appropriate works councils as
                     well as the statutory severance requirements of the
                     particular legal jurisdictions impacted, and the amount and
                     timing of the actual charges may vary due to a variety of
                     factors including the salary, position and number of years
                     of service of the affected employees as well as the type
                     and amount of severance benefits offered to employees. The
                     Efficiency Plan reflects the Corporation's intention only
                     and restructuring decisions at certain non-U.S. locations
                     remain subject to local labor law requirements, including
                     consultation with appropriate works councils.

                     addressed in the attached press release relating to forward
                     looking statements made in the press release, many factors
                     could affect the Efficiency Plan and the company's actual

                     implied by such forward-looking statements and assumptions.
                     All statements other than statements of historical fact are
                     statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements,
                     including but not limited to any projections, the extent or
                     timing of cost savings, charges, use of cost savings,
                     revenue or profitability improvements, or other financial
                     items; any statements of the plans, strategies, and
                     objectives of management for future operations, including
                     timing and execution of any restructuring plans, retirement
                     programs, benefit program changes or reorganizations and
                     extent of employees impacted; any statements concerning the

                     presently considers the factors set forth below to be the
                     important factors that could cause actual results to differ
                     materially from the company's published expectations:
                     risks, uncertainties and assumptions including the timing
                     and execution of plans and programs subject to local labor
                     law requirements, including consultation with appropriate
                     works councils; assumptions related to severance and
                     post-retirement costs; future acquisitions, dispositions,
                     investments, new business initiatives and changes in
                     product roadmap, development and manufacturing which may
                     affect expense and employment levels at the company;
                     assumptions relating to product demand and the business
                     environment; and other risk factors that are described from
                     time to time in the company's Securities and Exchange
                     Commission reports, including but not limited to the risk

     SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 17, 2006--Intel Corporation
today announced third-quarter revenue of $8.7 billion, operating income of $1.4
billion, net income of $1.3 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of 22 cents.
Excluding the effects of share-based compensation, the company posted operating
income of $1.7 billion, net income of $1.5 billion and EPS of 27 cents.

     Operating results included a gain of approximately $100 million from the
sale of a portion of an investment in Micron Technology, gains from divestitures
of approximately $130 million and a restructuring charge of $98 million. These
items resulted in a net positive impact to EPS of approximately 1.5 cents.

     "We're pleased with the results of the third quarter, with record mobile
and server processor shipments, strong manufacturing execution, industry acclaim
for our new products, and quad-core processors now extending our leadership this
quarter," said Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini.

     Financial Review

     The gross margin percentage was consistent with the company's expectation
in July as the impact of higher microprocessor revenue was offset by a write-off
of older processor inventory of approximately $100 million. Expenses (R&D plus
MG&A) were lower than expected primarily due to lower payroll and discretionary
spending. Net gains on equity investments and interest and other were higher
than forecast due to investment gains and gains on divestitures.

     Key Product Trends (Sequential)

     --   Total microprocessor units were higher. The ASP was lower.

     --   Chipset and motherboard units were higher.

     --   Flash memory units were lower.

     Sales Patterns

     Sequential revenue was above normal seasonal patterns in the Americas, EMEA
and Japan regions following a lower-than-seasonal second quarter for the
company. Microprocessor unit sales were higher than seasonally normal off a low
second-quarter base, and pricing remained competitive, notably in the desktop
segment.

     Business Outlook and Risk Factors Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

     The following expectations do not include the potential impact of any
mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other business combinations that may be
completed after Oct. 16.

     Q4 2006 Outlook

     --   Revenue: Expected to be between $9.1 billion and $9.7 billion.

     --   Gross margin: 50 percent, plus or minus a couple of points (51
          percent, plus or minus a couple of points, excluding share-based
          compensation effects of approximately 1 percent).

     --   Expenses (R&D plus MG&A): Between $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion
          (between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion excluding share-based
          compensation effects of approximately $250 million). In addition, the
          company expects restructuring charges of approximately $125 million.

     --   Net gains from equity investments and interest and other:
          Approximately $135 million.

     --   Tax rate: Approximately 30 percent.

     --   Depreciation: Between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion.

     --   R&D for 2006: Approximately $5.9 billion (approximately $5.4 billion
          excluding share-based compensation effects of approximately $500
          million).

     --   Capital spending for 2006: Between $5.7 billion and $5.9 billion,
          lower than the previous expectation primarily due to greater equipment
          reuse, productivity improvements and small timing changes.

     The above statements and any others in this document that refer to plans
and expectations for the fourth quarter, the year and the future are
forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.
Many factors could affect Intel's actual results, and variances from Intel's
current expectations regarding such factors could cause actual results to differ
materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Intel
presently considers the factors set forth below to be the important factors that
could cause actual results to differ materially from the Corporation's published
expectations:

     --   Intel operates in intensely competitive industries that are
          characterized by a high percentage of costs that are fixed or
          difficult to reduce in the short term, significant pricing pressures,
          and product demand that is highly variable and difficult to forecast.
          Additionally, Intel is transitioning to a new microarchitecture on
          65nm process technology in all major product segments, and there could
          be execution issues associated with these changes, including product
          defects and errata along with lower than anticipated manufacturing
          yields. Revenue and the gross margin percentage are affected by the
          timing of new Intel product introductions and the demand for and
          market acceptance of Intel's products; actions taken by Intel's
          competitors, including product offerings, marketing programs and
          pricing pressures and Intel's response to such actions; Intel's
          ability to respond quickly to technological developments and to
          incorporate new features into its products; and the availability of
          sufficient inventory of Intel products and related components from
          other suppliers to meet demand. Factors that could cause demand to be
          different from Intel's expectations include customer acceptance of
          Intel and competitors' products; changes in customer order patterns,
          including order cancellations; changes in the level of inventory at
          customers; and changes in business and economic conditions.

     --   The gross margin percentage could vary significantly from expectations
          based on changes in revenue levels; product mix and pricing; capacity
          utilization; variations in inventory valuation, including variations
          related to the timing of qualifying products for sale; excess or
          obsolete inventory; manufacturing yields; changes in unit costs;
          impairments of long-lived assets, including manufacturing,
          assembly/test and intangible assets; and the timing and execution of
          the manufacturing ramp and associated costs, including start-up costs.

     --   Expenses, particularly certain marketing and compensation expenses,
          vary depending on the level of demand for Intel's products and the
          level of revenue and profits.

     --   Intel is in the midst of a structure and efficiency review which is
          resulting in several actions that could have an impact on expected
          expense levels and gross margin.

     --   The tax rate expectation is based on current tax law and current
          expected income and assumes Intel continues to receive tax benefits
          for export sales. The tax rate may be affected by the closing of
          acquisitions or divestitures; the jurisdictions in which profits are
          determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the estimates of
          credits, benefits and deductions; the resolution of issues arising
          from tax audits with various tax authorities; and the ability to
          realize deferred tax assets.

     --   Gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other could
          vary from expectations depending on equity market levels and
          volatility; gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of
          securities; impairment charges related to marketable, non-marketable
          and other investments; interest rates; cash balances; and changes in
          fair value of derivative instruments.

     --   Dividend declarations and the dividend rate are at the discretion of
          Intel's board of directors, and plans for future dividends may be
          revised by the board. Intel's dividend and stock buyback programs
          could be affected by changes in its capital spending programs, changes
          in its cash flows and changes in the tax laws, as well as by the level
          and timing of acquisition and investment activity.

     --   Intel's results could be affected by the amount, type, and valuation
          of share-based awards granted as well as the amount of awards
          cancelled due to employee turnover and the timing of award exercises
          by employees.

     --   Intel's results could be impacted by unexpected economic, social,
          political and physical/infrastructure conditions in the countries in
          which Intel, its customers or its suppliers operate, including
          military conflict and other security risks, natural disasters,
          infrastructure disruptions, health concerns and fluctuations in
          currency exchange rates.

     --   Intel's results could be affected by adverse effects associated with
          product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications),
          and by litigation or regulatory matters involving intellectual
          property, stockholder, consumer, antitrust and other issues, such as
          the litigation and regulatory matters described in Intel's SEC
          reports.

     A more detailed discussion of these and other factors that could affect
Intel's results is included in Intel's SEC filings, including the report on Form
10-Q for the quarter ended July 1.

     Status of Business Outlook

     During the quarter, Intel's corporate representatives may reiterate the
Business Outlook during private meetings with investors, investment analysts,
the media and others. From the close of business on Dec. 1 until publication of
the company's fourth-quarter 2006 earnings release, Intel will observe a "Quiet
Period" during which the Business Outlook disclosed in the company's press
releases and filings with the SEC should be considered to be historical,
speaking as of prior to the Quiet Period only and not subject to update by the
company.

     The company's operating segments currently include the Digital Enterprise
     Group, the Mobility Group, the Flash Memory Group, the Digital Home Group,
     the Digital Health Group, and the Channel Platforms Group. The prior period
     amounts have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect reorganizations.

     The Digital Enterprise Group operating segment's products include
     microprocessors and related chipsets and motherboards designed for the
     desktop (including consumer desktop) and enterprise computing market
     segments, communications infrastructure components such as network
     processors and embedded microprocessors, wired connectivity devices, and
     products for network and server storage. The Mobility Group operating
     segment's products include microprocessors and related chipsets designed
     for the notebook computing market segment, wireless connectivity products,
     and application and cellular baseband processors used in handheld devices.
     In the second quarter of 2006, the company entered into an agreement to
     sell the business line that includes application and cellular baseband
     processors used in handheld devices. The Flash Memory Group operating
     segment includes NOR flash memory products designed for cellular phones and
     embedded form factors, and NAND flash memory products manufactured by IMFT
     that are designed for digital audio players and memory cards. Revenue for
     the "all other" category primarily relates to microprocessors and related
     chipsets sold by the Digital Home Group.

     In addition to these operating segments, the company has sales and
     marketing, manufacturing, finance, and administration groups. Expenses of
     these groups are generally allocated to the operating segments and are
     included in the operating results reported below. In addition to the
     operating results for the Digital Home Group, Digital Health Group, and
     Channel Platforms Group operating segments, the "all other" category
     includes certain corporate-level operating expenses, including a portion of
     profit-dependent bonus and other expenses not allocated to the operating
     segments. "All other" also includes the results of operations of seed
     businesses that support the company's initiatives. Additionally, "all
     other" includes acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any
     impairments of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill, and charges
     for purchased in-process research and development. Intel does not allocate
     share-based compensation charges or restructuring charges to the operating
     segments; as such, these charges are included in "all other."



In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company's earnings release
contains non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effects of share-based
compensation and the requirements of SFAS No. 123(R), "Share-based Payment"
("123R"). The non-GAAP financial measures used by management and disclosed by
the company exclude the income statement effects of all forms of share-based
compensation and the effects of 123R upon the number of diluted shares used in
calculating non-GAAP earnings per share. The non-GAAP financial measures
disclosed by the company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior
to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial
results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those
financial statements should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial
measures used by the company may be calculated differently from, and therefore
may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. Set
forth below are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most
directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

For additional information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures, see the
Form 8-K dated October 17, 2006 that Intel has filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
