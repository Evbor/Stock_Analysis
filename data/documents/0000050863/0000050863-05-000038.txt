Item         Departure   of  Directors  or  Principal   Officers;
5.02         Election  of  Directors;  Appointment  of  Principal
             Officers

               Intel  Corporation (the "Company") is filing  this
             amendment  to its Current Report on Form  8-K  filed
             on   November   15,   2004  to  provide   additional
             information that was not determined or available  at
             the   time  the  original  report  was  filed.   The
             November  15,  2004 Form 8-K reported,  among  other
             things,  that  on November 10, 2004,  the  Company's
             Board  of  Directors  elected Paul  S.  Otellini  as
             President  and  Chief  Executive  Officer   of   the
             Company and Dr. Craig R. Barrett as Chairman of  the
             Board  of the Company, effective as of the Company's
             annual  meeting  of stockholders in  May  2005.   On
             February 2, 2005, the Compensation Committee of  the
             Board  of  Directors  of the  Company  approved  the
             salary  and other compensation arrangements  of  Mr.
             Otellini and Dr. Barrett, as described below.

               Mr.  Otellini's employment with the Company is  on
             an  at-will  basis.  The Compensation Committee  set
             his  base  salary  for 2005 at  $550,000  per  year,
             effective  as  of  January  1.   Effective  June  1,
             following his promotion to Chief Executive  Officer,
             his  base salary will increase to $650,000 per year.
             In   addition  to  base  salary,  Mr.  Otellini   is
             eligible   for  performance  incentive  compensation
             under  the  Company's  Executive  Officer  Incentive
             Plan  ("EOIP").   As  described more  fully  in  the
             Company's  2004  Proxy Statement, awards  under  the
             EOIP  are  determined by multiplying  the  officer's
             individual incentive target by Intel's earnings  per
             share  for the year (as adjusted by the Compensation
             Committee  of  the  Board of  Directors)  and  by  a
             performance  factor established by the  Compensation
             Committee.   Individual awards under  the  EOIP  are
             capped  at $5,000,000 and the Compensation Committee
             has  the discretion to reduce (but not increase) the
             award.   Mr. Otellini's individual incentive  target
             for  2005  under  the  EOIP  is  currently  set   at
             $600,000.    Effective  June  1,  his  target   will
             increase to $750,000.  Mr. Otellini's actual  payout
             under   the  EOIP,  which  will  be  based  on   the
             Company's   fiscal  2005  results,   will   not   be
             determined  until early 2006 and will  comprise  the
             prorated payouts for each target.

                Mr.   Otellini  received  a  long-term  executive
             performance  stock option grant for  400,000  shares
             on  February  2,  2005.  This  grant  vests  in  25%
             annual  increments  beginning four  years  from  the
             date   of   grant.   Mr.  Otellini  will   also   be
             recommended  for  a  stock  option  grant   covering
             500,000  shares  in  April in  connection  with  the
             Company's   annual  stock  option   grant   program.
             Annual  stock  option  grants  vest  in  25%  annual
             increments  beginning  one year  from  the  date  of
             grant.

<PAGE>

               Dr.  Barrett's employment with the Company is also
             on  an  at-will  basis.  The Compensation  Committee
             set  his  base  salary for 2005  at  $610,000.   Dr.
             Barrett   also  participates  in  the   EOIP.    His
             individual incentive target for 2005 under EOIP  has
             been  set  at  $700,000.  As with Mr. Otellini,  his
             actual  payout under the EOIP will be determined  in
             early  2006  based on the Company's performance  for
             2005.   Dr. Barrett will also be recommended  for  a
             stock  option grant covering 250,000 shares in April
             in   connection  with  the  Company's  annual  stock
             option grant program.  As noted above, annual  stock
             option   grants   vest  in  25%  annual   increments
             beginning one year from the date of grant.

               Both Mr. Otellini and Dr. Barrett also participate
             in  the  Company's semiannual cash award program  in
             which  they will receive 0.55 day of pay (calculated
             based   on   eligible  earnings  for  the  six-month
             period,  including one-half of incentive targets  as
             applicable)  for  every  two  percentage  points  of
             corporate   pretax  margin  (pretax  profit   as   a
             percentage of revenue), or a total payment based  on
             4%  of  net  income, whichever is greater.   Payouts
             under  this program are made in the first and  third
             quarters  of the year based on corporate performance
             for  the  previous two quarters.  The  program  also
             provides  an  extra  day  of  pay  if  the   Company
             achieves  its  customer satisfaction goals  for  the
             performance period.

               In addition, both Mr. Otellini and Dr. Barrett are
             eligible  to receive Company contributions to  their
             accounts  in  the Company's tax-qualified  and  non-
             qualified  capital  accumulation/retirement   plans.
             Company    contributions   to   these   plans    are
             discretionary  and  may  vary  with  the   Company's
             financial  performance,  particularly  revenue   and
             income.    Since   the   amount   of   the   Company
             contribution  to the tax-qualified plan  is  limited
             by  U.S.  tax law, the excess, if any, is  allocated
             to  the  individual's account in  the  non-qualified
             plan.   The  amount of the 2005 Company contribution
             to  these  plans will be determined  in  early  2006
             based on the Company's performance for fiscal 2005.
