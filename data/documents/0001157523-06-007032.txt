Item 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

          Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein
          is financial information for Intel Corporation for the quarter ended
          July 1, 2006 and forward-looking statements relating to 2006 and the
          third quarter of 2006 as presented in a press release of July 19,
          2006. The information in this report shall be deemed incorporated by
          reference into any registration statement heretofore or hereafter
          filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except to the
          extent that such information is superseded by information as of a
          subsequent date that is included in or incorporated by reference into
          such registration statement. The information in this report shall not
          be treated as filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of
          1934, as amended.

          In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance
          with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles
          (GAAP), the company's earnings release contains non-GAAP financial
          measures that exclude the effects of share-based compensation and the
          requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
          (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" (SFAS No. 123(R)). The non-GAAP
          financial measures used by management and disclosed by the company
          exclude the income statement effects of all forms of share-based
          compensation and the effects of SFAS No. 123(R) upon the number of
          diluted common shares used in calculating non-GAAP earnings per share.
          The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the company should not be
          considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures
          calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results
          calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those
          financial statements should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP
          financial measures used by the company may be calculated differently
          from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled
          measures used by other companies. The company has provided
          reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most
          directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The company applied the
          modified prospective method of adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), under
          which the effects of SFAS No. 123(R) are reflected in the company's
          GAAP financial statement presentations for and after the first quarter
          2006, but are not reflected in results for prior periods.

          In managing the company's business on a consolidated basis, consistent
          with how we managed the business prior to implementation of FAS
          123(R), management develops an annual budget that includes all
          components of the income statement, exclusive of share-based
          compensation. Gross margin, expenses (research and development and
          marketing, general and administrative), operating income, income
          taxes, net income and diluted earnings per share (EPS) are the primary
          consolidated financial measures management uses for planning and
          forecasting future periods that are affected by shared-based
          compensation. The company's budget and planning process commences with
          a segment-level evaluation which excludes share-based compensation,
          and culminates with the preparation of a consolidated annual and/or
          quarterly budget that includes these non-GAAP financial measures. This
          budget, once finalized and approved, serves as the basis for the
          allocation of resources and management of operations. The number of
          full-time equivalent employees working in manufacturing, research and
          development and marketing, general and administrative related roles is
          determined through the budgeting process exclusive of share-based
          compensation. Segment managers are not held accountable for
          share-based compensation charges and therefore the budget and planning
          process, which involves headcount planning, excludes the effects of
          share-based compensation. In addition, our tax strategies are
          determined on a consolidated basis exclusive of the expenses and
          related tax benefit relating to share-based compensation. The
          accounting expense impact of share-based compensation is not discussed
          nor considered when assessing and determining the appropriate level of
          budgeted expenses for gross margin, research and development,
          marketing, general and administrative expenses. Accordingly, such
          amounts are also excluded from the budgeted operating income, net
          income and earnings per share. GAAP-basis financial statements which
          include the effects of share-based compensation are only reviewed and
          analyzed for purposes of external reporting where GAAP-basis financial
          statements are necessary.

                                       2

          Under our budget and planning process, consistent with prior to the
          adoption of FAS 123(R), when we seek to reduce unit costs with the
          goal of increasing gross margin, management does not consider the
          effects of share-based compensation. When assessing the level of R&D
          effort currently or prospectively, consistent with prior to the
          adoption of FAS 123(R), management does not consider the effects of
          share-based compensation. When making decisions about project
          spending, administrative budgets, or marketing programs, management
          does not consider the effects of share-based compensation.

          In addition to using the budget process for planning and resource
          allocation, on a quarterly basis we analyze the performance of our
          business on a consolidated basis by comparing our gross margin,
          expenses (research and development and marketing, general and
          administrative), operating income, net income and diluted earnings per
          share, each excluding share-based compensation, to the prior period
          and forecasted amounts developed during the budget and planning
          process, also excluding share-based compensation. We use these
          quarterly assessments to evaluate the performance of the business
          against prior periods and budget and to develop our business outlook
          which we communicate to investors.

          Consistent with prior to the adoption of FAS 123(R), the company's
          share-based compensation programs are established and managed on a
          company-wide basis, including specification of grant types and amount
          ranges for employees by category and grade. Our philosophy relative to
          share-based compensation programs is built on the principle that
          equity compensation should seek to align employees' actions and
          behaviors with stockholders' interest; be market competitive; be able
          to attract, motivate and retain the best employees; and support
          Intel's belief in a broad-based approach. Share based compensation
          granted to employees is in addition to, not in lieu of, cash
          compensation. Accordingly, our share-based compensation program is
          evaluated separately from the cost of other compensation programs.
          Specifically, our share-based compensation programs are carefully
          evaluated from the perspective of the resulting dilution and other
          metrics, and not from the resulting expense to be recorded. For
          example, our goal has been to keep the potential incremental dilution
          related to our equity incentive programs (stock options and restricted
          stock units) to a long-term average of less than 2% annually. The
          dilution percentage is calculated using the new equity-based awards,
          net of equity-based awards cancelled due to employees leaving the
          company and expired stock options, divided by the total outstanding
          shares at the beginning of the year. Further, as noted above, segment
          managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation
          charges, and these charges do not impact their business unit's
          operating income (loss). Accordingly, share-based compensation charges
          also are excluded from the company's measure of segment profitability
          (operating income). Therefore, when evaluating segment and operating
          income, management and the Board of Directors exclude share-based
          compensation.

                                       3

          Operating income and net income, both on a per-share basis, are
          calculated excluding share-based compensation for purposes of
          evaluating profit-dependent cash incentive compensation paid to
          employees, including senior management. For example, for 2006 the
          executive compensation cash incentive plan formula measures EPS as the
          greater of (x) Intel's operating income or (y) Intel's net income (in
          both cases excluding the effect of share-based compensation), divided
          by Intel's weighted average diluted common shares outstanding,
          excluding the effects of share-based compensation. The calculation of
          diluted common shares outstanding, excluding the effects of
          share-based compensation, excludes the proceeds from the remaining
          unamortized share-based compensation, and adjusts the proceeds from
          tax benefits by excluding the effects of share-based compensation. The
          calculation of diluted common shares outstanding, excluding the
          effects of share-based compensation is similar to the calculation of
          diluted common shares outstanding, as reported, prior to the adoption
          of SFAS 123(R). Accordingly, when budgeting for the company's
          profit-dependent cash incentives, the company applies the formula
          above to calculate earnings per share excluding share-based
          compensation so as to be able to factor the appropriate amount of
          profit dependent cash incentive into the budget.

          The company discloses this non-GAAP information to the public to
          enable investors who wish to more easily assess the company's
          performance on the same basis applied by management and to ease
          comparison on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis to our prior period
          results. In particular, as the company begins to apply SFAS No.
          123(R), the company believes that it is useful to investors to
          understand how the expenses and other adjustments associated with the
          application of SFAS No. 123(R) are being reflected on the company's
          income statements. Management believes gross margin, excluding
          share-based compensation, R&D, excluding share-based compensation, and
          marketing, general, and administrative, excluding share-based
          compensation, are useful information for investors because the GAAP
          measure when compared in isolation with last year would indicate a
          level of increase in those expenses inconsistent with actual
          performance. We believe that the non-GAAP measures serve to provide a
          baseline for investors in this first year of adoption to compare
          actual results for the current year, excluding share-based
          compensation to the prior year GAAP amounts which exclude share-based
          compensation. We believe this comparison also is useful to allow
          investors to more easily evaluate our results from a period-to-period
          comparability perspective.

          Management believes operating income and net income, excluding
          share-based compensation, is useful information to investors because
          it assists investors in evaluating operating income and net income
          consistent with how management evaluates performance and to understand
          the basis for the company's profit dependent cash incentive plan.
          Especially in this first year of applying the provisions of FAS
          123(R), we believe operating and net income as reported in our income
          statement are not comparable to prior year period amounts, and may
          lead the investor to believing business has declined more
          significantly than would be caused by actual changes in the business
          (as opposed to changes in accounting treatment between years). When
          presenting net income, excluding share-based compensation, we believe
          it appropriate to exclude the related tax benefit recognized in the
          financial statements for purposes of presenting net income or EPS,
          excluding share-based compensation. Providing diluted earnings per
          share, excluding share-based compensation assists investors in
          evaluating diluted earnings per share compared to prior periods.
          Especially in this first year of applying the provisions of FAS
          123(R), we believe diluted earnings per share as reported in our
          income statement is not comparable to prior year amounts.

                                       4

          The basis for the company's decision to use these non-GAAP measures
          excluding share-based compensation is that management has determined
          in this first year of adoption of FAS 123(R) to continue to evaluate
          the business on the same basis as prior to the implementation of FAS
          123(R) until there is greater familiarity with its effects and until
          the second year after adoption of FAS 123(R) when financial
          information is prepared and presented on a consistent basis with the
          prior year. Share-based compensation represents: 0.8 points of gross
          margin, $126 million of research and development expenses, $140
          million of marketing, general and administrative expenses, $332
          million reduction in total operating income, $239 million reduction in
          total net income, and a $0.04 reduction in diluted earnings per share
          for the quarter ended July 1, 2006, compared to zero for all such
          measures in the quarter ended July 2, 2005. Share-based compensation
          represents: 1 point of gross margin, $135 million of research and
          development expenses, $153 million of marketing, general and
          administrative expenses, $374 million reduction in total operating
          income, $264 million reduction in total net income, and a $0.04
          reduction in diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended April 1,
          2006.

          Unlike other forms of compensation, share-based compensation was not
          recognized prior to January 1, 2006 when we adopted the provisions of
          SFAS No. 123(R). Additionally, when management determines the annual
          merit and promotional budget for compensation, the expense effects of
          share-based compensation are not considered. Rather share-based awards
          are generally granted via a fixed formula depending on position and
          level of the employee. In addition, segment managers are held
          accountable for other forms of compensation, and as such those
          compensation charges are included in the segments' results and in the
          budget and planning processes of our reporting segments.

          A material limitation associated with the use of these measures as
          compared to the related GAAP measures is that they may reduce
          comparability with other companies who may use different types of
          equity incentive awards, or whose compensation structures may use
          share-based compensation to a greater or lesser extent as part of
          their overall compensation. These differences may cause our non-GAAP
          measures excluding share-based compensation to not be comparable to
          other companies' non-GAAP measures excluding share-based compensation.
          Other material limitations associated with the use of these measures
          as compared to the GAAP comparable measure include: gross margin,
          excluding share-based compensation does not include all costs related
          to the cost of inventory sold during the period; research and
          development, excluding share-based compensation does not include all
          costs related to the research and development needed to bring new
          products to the market; marketing, general and administrative expenses
          excluding share-based compensation does not include all costs related
          to the marketing, general and administrative efforts required to
          manage our company and sell our products. A material limitation with
          using operating income excluding share-based compensation, net income
          excluding share-based compensation and diluted earnings per share,
          excluding share-based compensation is that they do not include all
          costs typically included in the presentation of the comparable GAAP
          measure, and they may not include all costs related to hiring and
          retaining qualified employees.

                                       5

          Although these non-GAAP financial measures adjust cost, expenses and
          diluted share items to exclude the accounting treatment of share-based
          compensation, they should not be viewed as a pro forma presentation
          reflecting the elimination of the underlying share-based compensation
          programs. Thus, our non-GAAP presentations are not intended to
          present, and should not be used, as a basis for assessing what our
          operating results might be if we were to eliminate our share-based
          compensation programs. Our equity incentive programs are an important
          element of the company's compensation structure and generally accepted
          accounting principles indicate that all forms of share-based payments
          should be valued and included as appropriate in results of operations.

          Because of the foregoing limitations, management does not intend to
          use the non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the company's
          performance against that of other companies. The company manages its
          share-based programs in the aggregate against certain metrics rather
          than reviewing financial statement impacts by financial statement line
          item. Specifically, our goal has been to keep the potential
          incremental dilution related to our equity incentive programs (stock
          options and restricted stock units) to a long-term average of less
          than 2% annually. The dilution percentage is calculated using the new
          equity-based awards, net of equity-based awards cancelled due to
          employees leaving the company and expired stock options, divided by
          the total outstanding shares at the beginning of the year.

    Financial Review

    Second-quarter gross margin was 52.1 percent, versus an
expectation in April of 49 percent, plus or minus a couple of points.
Gross margin benefited from better than expected microprocessor and
chipset unit costs and inventory valuation, offset by lower than
expected microprocessor average selling prices (ASPs).

    Key Product Trends (Sequential)

    --  Total microprocessor units were lower. The ASP was lower.

    --  Chipset units were flat.

    --  Motherboard units were lower.

    --  Flash memory units were higher.

    Sales Patterns

    Sequential revenue in all of the company's major regions was below
normal seasonal patterns. Microprocessor unit sales were below
seasonal patterns as customers reduced their processor inventory
levels to seasonally appropriate levels in a highly competitive
pricing environment.

    Recent Events

    --  Intel opened its third 65nm, 300mm wafer fab during the
        quarter. The company's advanced technology is sustaining
        record high yields and is on track to enable a shipment
        crossover to 65nm processors during the third quarter.

    --  The company began a major transition to the energy-efficient
        Intel Core microarchitecture, the most significant design
        improvement since the architecture of the Pentium(R) 4
        processor was introduced in 2000. For dual-processor servers,
        the company launched the Intel(R) Xeon(R) 5100 family, setting
        a broad range of new world records in X86 server performance
        and performance-per-watt. The Intel(R) Core(TM) 2 Duo
        processor for desktop PCs began shipping during the quarter
        ahead of its formal launch July 27 and has already set
        performance records across dozens of industry-standard PC
        performance tests. The mobile PC version of the Intel Core 2
        Duo processor is also shipping now, one month ahead of
        schedule.

    --  For large enterprise servers, Intel launched the Dual-Core
        Intel(R) Itanium(R) 2 processor, bringing as much as twice the
        performance of earlier models while using 20 percent less
        power.

    --  The company announced that its next-generation Intel Xeon
        processor for multiprocessor (MP) servers is shipping now,
        approximately two quarters ahead of schedule. Intel also
        notified customers that its first quad-core microprocessors
        for server and desktop systems are ahead of schedule, with
        shipments expected in the fourth quarter of this year rather
        than the first half of 2007.

    --  Intel ramped production of new chipsets on its 90nm, 300mm
        technology. The company launched the Intel(R) 965 Express
        chipset, formerly code-named Broadwater, which supports
        advanced manageability, power management and memory control
        features. One version of the chipset family will offer
        programmable fourth-generation integrated graphics.

    --  Under an ongoing program to improve operational efficiency and
        results, the company announced the planned sale of its
        communications and application processor business to Marvell
        Technology Group. The company also eliminated approximately
        1,000 management positions within the company.

        Approximately $45 million, unchanged.

    The above statements and any others in this document that refer to
plans and expectations for the third quarter, the year and the future
involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause
Intel's actual results to differ materially from current expectations,
including the following:

    --  Intel operates in intensely competitive industries that are
        characterized by a high percentage of costs that are fixed or
        difficult to reduce in the short term, significant pricing
        pressures, and product demand that is highly variable and
        difficult to forecast. Additionally, Intel is in the midst of
        a crossover to a new microarchitecture on 65nm process
        technology in all major product segments, and there could be
        execution issues associated with these changes, including
        product defects and errata along with lower than anticipated
        manufacturing yields. Revenue and the gross margin percentage
        are affected by the timing of new Intel product introductions
        and the demand for and market acceptance of Intel's products;
        actions taken by Intel's competitors, including product
        offerings, marketing programs and pricing pressures and
        Intel's response to such actions; Intel's ability to respond
        quickly to technological developments and to incorporate new
        features into its products; and the availability of sufficient
        inventory of Intel products and related components from other
        suppliers to meet demand. Factors that could cause demand to
        be different from Intel's expectations include customer
        acceptance of Intel and competitors' products; changes in
        customer order patterns, including order cancellations;
        changes in the level of inventory at customers; and changes in
        business and economic conditions.

    --  The gross margin percentage could vary significantly from
        expectations based on changes in revenue levels; product mix
        and pricing; variations in inventory valuation, including
        variations related to the timing of qualifying products for
        sale; excess or obsolete inventory; manufacturing yields;
        changes in unit costs; capacity utilization; impairments of
        long-lived assets, including manufacturing, assembly/test and
        intangible assets; and the timing and execution of the
        manufacturing ramp and associated costs, including start-up
        costs.

    --  Expenses, particularly certain marketing and compensation
        expenses, vary depending on the level of demand for Intel's
        products and the level of revenue and profits. Intel is in the
        midst of a structure and efficiency review which may result in
        several actions that could have an impact on expense levels.

    --  The tax rate expectation is based on current tax law and
        current expected income and assumes Intel continues to receive
        tax benefits for export sales. The tax rate may be affected by
        the closing of acquisitions or divestitures; the jurisdictions
        in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;
        changes in the estimates of credits, benefits and deductions;
        the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various
        tax authorities; and the ability to realize deferred tax
        assets.

    --  Gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other
        could vary from expectations depending on equity market levels
        and volatility; gains or losses realized on the sale or
        exchange of securities; impairment charges related to
        marketable, non-marketable and other investments; interest
        rates; cash balances; and changes in fair value of derivative
        instruments.

    --  Dividend declarations and the dividend rate are at the
        discretion of Intel's board of directors, and plans for future
        dividends may be revised by the board. Intel's dividend and
        stock buyback programs could be affected by changes in its
        capital spending programs, changes in its cash flows and
        changes in the tax laws, as well as by the level and timing of
        acquisition and investment activity.

    --  Intel's results could be affected by the amount, type, and
        valuation of share-based awards granted as well as the amount
        of awards cancelled due to employee turnover and the timing of
        award exercises by employees.

    --  Intel's results could be impacted by unexpected economic,
        social, political and physical/infrastructure conditions in
        the countries in which Intel, its customers or its suppliers
        operate, including military conflict and other security risks,
        natural disasters, infrastructure disruptions, health concerns
        and fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

    --  Intel's results could be affected by adverse effects
        associated with product defects and errata (deviations from
        published specifications), and by litigation or regulatory
        matters involving intellectual property, stockholder,
        consumer, antitrust and other issues, such as the litigation
        and regulatory matters described in Intel's SEC reports.

    A more detailed discussion of these and other factors that could
affect results is included in Intel's SEC filings, including the
report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 1, 2006.

    Status of Business Outlook

    During the quarter, Intel's corporate representatives may

The company's operating segments include the Digital Enterprise Group,
the Mobility Group, the Flash Memory Group, the Digital Home Group,
the Digital Health Group and the Channel Platforms Group. The prior
period amounts have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect certain
reorganizations.

The Digital Enterprise Group operating segment's products include
microprocessors and related chipsets and motherboards designed for the
desktop (including consumer desktop) and enterprise computing market
segments, communications infrastructure components such as network
processors and embedded microprocessors, wired connectivity devices,
and products for network and server storage. The Mobility Group
operating segment's products include microprocessors and related
chipsets designed for the notebook computing market segment, wireless
connectivity products, and application and cellular baseband
processors used in cellular handsets and handheld computing devices.
In the second quarter of 2006, the company entered into an agreement
to sell the business line that includes application and cellular
baseband processors used in cellular handsets and handheld computing
devices. The Flash Memory Group operating segment's products include
NOR flash memory products designed for cellular phones and embedded
form factors as well as NAND flash memory products designed primarily
for digital audio players.

Results for the Digital Home Group, Digital Health Group and Channel
Platforms Group operating segments are included within the "all other"
category. Revenue for the "all other" category primarily consists of
microprocessors and related chipsets sold by the Digital Home Group.
The "all other" category includes certain corporate-level operating
expenses, including a portion of profit-dependent bonus and other
expenses not allocated to the operating segments. "All other" also
includes the results of operations of seed businesses that support the
company's initiatives. Additionally, "all other" includes
acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairments
of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill, and charges for
purchased in-process research and development. Beginning in the first
quarter of 2006, "all other" includes share-based compensation
resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 123R.

In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the
company's earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures that
exclude the effects of share-based compensation and the requirements
of SFAS No. 123R, "Share-based Payment" ("123R"). The non-GAAP
financial measures used by management and disclosed by the company
exclude the income statement effects of all forms of share-based
compensation and the effects of 123R upon the number of diluted shares
used in calculating non-GAAP earnings per share. The non-GAAP
financial measures disclosed by the company should not be considered a
substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in
accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in
accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements
should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measures used by
the company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not
be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Set forth below are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures
to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

For additional information regarding these non-GAAP financial
measures, see the Form 8-K dated July 19, 2006 that Intel has filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
