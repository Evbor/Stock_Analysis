NEWS RELEASE

   CLEARWIRE SECURES $900M IN FINANCING ROUND LED BY INTEL
    CAPITAL AND ANNOUNCES THE SALE OF NEXTNET WIRELESS TO
                          MOTOROLA

Transactions to Accelerate the Development and Deployment of
                       WiMAX Networks

   $600M Investment from Intel Capital, the Largest in its
                           History

   Clearwire Selects Motorola to Supply Wireless Broadband
                          Equipment

KIRKLAND, Wash., SANTA CLARA, Calif., and SCHAUMBURG, Ill.

(July 5, 2006) - Clearwire Corporation, a high-speed

wireless broadband services provider founded by Craig McCaw,

today announced a series of transactions with Intel Capital,

the venture capital investment arm of Intel Corporation,

Motorola and Motorola Ventures to accelerate the development

and deployment of portable and mobile WiMAX networks based

on the IEEE 802.16e-2005 standard. The transactions include

Intel Capital's investment of $600 million as part of a $900

million private financing round and Motorola's acquisition

of Clearwire's subsidiary NextNet Wireless, a leading

provider of OFDM-based non-line-of-sight (NLOS) wireless

broadband infrastructure equipment. Motorola Ventures is

also participating in the financing round.

     Following closing of the transactions, Motorola will

supply wireless broadband equipment for Clearwire's existing

and future networks globally. To hasten the proliferation of

mobile WiMAX in PC clients, Intel will work to enable the

inclusion of WiMAX chipsets in next generation mobile

computing platforms. All three parties will contribute

significant research and development resources to evolve

NextNet Wireless' pre-WiMAX technologies.

<PAGE>

     "The size of this investment from Intel Capital

underscores our commitment to supporting wireless broadband

using WiMAX networks in the United States," said Intel

Capital President Arvind Sodhani. "Our collaboration with

Clearwire and Motorola builds on the foundation of previous

WiMAX network deployment investments made by Intel Capital

throughout the world to bring the benefits of mobile high-

speed and content-rich Internet access to wireless broadband

users."

     "Wi-Fi has become an essential part of people's lives.

WiMAX is next. It is rapidly moving from a technology

initiative to real deployments," said Sean Maloney Intel

executive vice president and general manager, Mobility

Group. "As Intel plans the integration of mobile WiMAX into

our Centrino Mobile Technology notebook platforms, it is

incredibly important to collaborate with the broadband

wireless providers who will offer WiMAX services. This

investment in Clearwire will lay the foundation for high-

speed mobile broadband services across North America."

     As part of the transaction, Motorola will acquire

Clearwire's subsidiary NextNet Wireless, one of the

industry's leading fixed and portable NLOS wireless

broadband equipment suppliers, for an undisclosed amount.

NextNet's wireless access products are currently deployed by

carriers on five continents. Acquiring NextNet broadens

Motorola's global portfolio of solutions to serve the

rapidly growing need for wireless broadband equipment.

      "We look forward to accelerating the benefits of WiMAX

low-cost, high-speed wireless internet access to consumers

around the world," said Greg Brown, president of Motorola's

networks and enterprise business. "Our acquisition of

NextNet furthers

<PAGE>

Motorola's strategy to continue to expand and profitably

grow our wireless broadband business and furthers our

efforts in seamless wireless broadband mobility."

     "Collaborating with Intel and Motorola significantly

advances our vision for fixed, portable and mobile wireless

broadband services," said Craig McCaw, founder, chairman,

and co-CEO of Clearwire. "Wireless broadband networks will

enable the creation and delivery of differentiated services

and applications that enhance the way people communicate and

experience the Internet."

     "These agreements mark a significant milestone for

Clearwire," said Ben Wolff, co-CEO of Clearwire. "We believe

that there is strong demand for wireless broadband

connectivity that is simple, fast, reliable and

affordable. Working together with Intel and Motorola to

deploy mobile WiMAX technology will provide us with the

benefits of a standards-based platform, which will further

enhance our efforts to address this demand."

     Closing of the transactions is subject to regulatory

approval and certain closing conditions.
