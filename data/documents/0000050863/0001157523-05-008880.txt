Item 2.02      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

               Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference
               herein is financial information for Intel Corporation for the
               quarter ended October 1, 2005 and forward-looking statements
               relating to 2005 and the fourth quarter of 2005 as presented in a
               press release of October 18, 2005. The information in this report
               shall be deemed incorporated by reference into any registration
               statement heretofore or hereafter filed under the Securities Act
               of 1933, as amended, except to the extent that such information
               is superceded by information as of a subsequent date that is
               included in or incorporated by reference into such registration
               statement. The information in this report shall not be treated as
               filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
               amended.

               In addition to presenting financial results calculated in
               accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
               (GAAP), the company's earnings release contains a non-GAAP
               financial measure which excludes the effects of a legal
               settlement with MicroUnity, Inc. from the third quarter gross
               margin percentage. This non-GAAP financial measure should be
               considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior
               to, gross margin calculated in accordance with GAAP. In the
               earnings release, the company has provided a reconciliation of
               the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable
               GAAP financial measure.

               The company's management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to
               evaluate the company's operating performance for the third
               quarter of 2005, and for budgeting and planning purposes, because
               the third quarter charge for the legal settlement primarily
               relates to prior periods. GAAP requires that the company include
               a charge in the third quarter results which relates to the prior
               use of the licenses being granted as part of the legal settlement
               in connection with sales of products in historical periods going
               back several years. Management also uses this non-GAAP financial
               measure in evaluating both the changes in third quarter operating
               results that are attributable to the company's on-going business
               operations and the change that is attributable to the legal
               settlement and was not anticipated at the time of the company's
               Mid-Quarter Business Update press release on September 8, 2005.
               The company believes this information is useful to investors for
               the same reasons it is useful to management.

Intel Announces Record Revenue of $9.96 Billion; EPS of 32 Cents Includes Legal
Settlement that Lowered EPS by Approximately 2 Cents

     SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 18, 2005--Intel Corporation
today announced record revenue of $9.96 billion for the third quarter, up 18
percent year-over-year and up 8 percent sequentially.
     Third-quarter operating income was $3.1 billion, up 31 percent
year-over-year and up 17 percent sequentially, and includes the impact of a
legal settlement discussed below. Net income was $2 billion, up 5 percent
year-over-year and down 2 percent sequentially. Earnings per share (EPS) were 32
cents, up 7 percent from 30 cents in the third quarter of 2004 and down 3
percent from 33 cents in the second quarter of 2005. Third-quarter net income
and EPS included the impact of a legal settlement and tax item discussed below.
     "In the third quarter, we achieved all-time records in company revenue and
unit shipments across all of our major product lines," said Paul Otellini, Intel
president and CEO. "Execution remained solid as we launched our new dual-core
server platform ahead of schedule and began shipping microprocessors built on
our industry-leading 65nm process technology. The combination of our 65nm
manufacturing network, broad range of new dual-core processors and unique
ability to provide platform solutions positions us well for continued growth."
     Earlier this month, Intel and MicroUnity Inc. entered into a settlement
agreement that resolves a patent infringement case and provides certain rights
for Intel customers. Under the agreement, Intel will pay $300 million to
MicroUnity. Intel recorded a preliminary $140-million charge to third-quarter
cost of sales, which reduced earnings per share by approximately 2 cents. The
remaining $160 million represents the value of intellectual property assets that
are expected to be amortized over approximately 10 years. The company expects to
finalize the accounting by the time of the filing of the third-quarter Form
10-Q.
     As discussed in the company's Sept. 8 Mid-Quarter Business Update, Intel's
results for the third quarter included the impact of an increase in taxes of
approximately $250 million, equivalent to 4 cents per share, related to the
decision to repatriate foreign-earned income under the American Jobs Creation
Act (Jobs Act). The company's results for last year's third quarter included a
tax adjustment that increased earnings-per-share by 3 cents. Intel's results for
the previous quarter included a tax adjustment that increased earnings-per-share
by approximately 2 cents.

     BUSINESS OUTLOOK

     The following statements are based on current expectations. These
statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. Please
see the Risk Factors Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this release for a
description of certain important risk factors that could cause actual results to
differ, and refer to Intel's annual and quarterly reports on file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a more complete description of the
risks. These statements do not include the potential impact of any mergers,
acquisitions, divestitures, investments or other business combinations that may
be completed after Oct. 17.

     --   Revenue in the fourth quarter is expected to be between $10.2 billion
          and $10.8 billion.

     --   Gross margin percentage for the fourth quarter is expected to be
          approximately 63 percent, plus or minus a couple of points, as
          compared to 59.7 percent in the third quarter. The gross margin
          percentage could vary from expectations based on changes in revenue
          levels; product mix and pricing; variations in inventory valuation,
          including variations related to the timing of qualifying products for
          sale; excess or obsolete inventory; manufacturing yields; changes in
          unit costs; capacity utilization; impairments of long-lived assets,
          including manufacturing, assembly/test and intangible assets; and the
          timing and execution of the manufacturing ramp and associated costs,
          including start-up costs.

     --   Expenses (R&D plus MG&A) in the fourth quarter are expected to be
          approximately $3 billion, higher than $2.8 billion in the third
          quarter, primarily driven by seasonally higher marketing spending
          along with higher revenue- and profit-dependent spending. Expenses,
          particularly certain marketing and compensation expenses, vary
          depending on the level of demand for Intel's products and the level of
          revenue and profits.

     --   The R&D spending expectation for 2005 is unchanged at approximately
          $5.2 billion.

     --   The capital spending expectation for 2005 is unchanged at
          approximately $5.9 billion, plus or minus $200 million.

     --   Gains from equity investments and interest and other in the fourth
          quarter are expected to be approximately $130 million.

     --   The fourth-quarter tax rate is expected to be approximately 31
          percent. The tax rate expectation is based on current tax law and
          current expected income and assumes Intel continues to receive tax
          benefits for export sales. The tax rate may be affected by the closing
          of acquisitions or divestitures; the jurisdiction in which profits are
          determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the estimates of
          credits, benefits and deductions; as well as the taxes associated with
          repatriation of cash under the Jobs Act; the resolution of issues
          arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; and the ability
          to realize deferred tax assets.

     --   Depreciation for the fourth quarter is expected to be between $1
          billion and $1.1 billion.

     --   Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs is expected
          to be approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter.

     THIRD-QUARTER REVIEW AND RECENT HIGHLIGHTS

     Financial Review

     --   The gross margin percentage was 59.7 percent including the impact of
          the MicroUnity legal settlement. Gross margin excluding the impact of
          the settlement would have been 61.1 percent, slightly above the range
          provided in the Sept. 8 Business Update.

     --   Intel used $2.5 billion in cash to repurchase 93.6 million shares of
          its common stock during the quarter under an ongoing program.

     --   The company paid a cash dividend of 8 cents per share on Sept. 1 to
          stockholders of record on Aug. 7.

     Key Product Trends (Sequential)

     --   Total microprocessor units set a record. The average selling price was
          approximately flat.

     --   Chipset units set a record.

     --   Motherboard units were lower.

     --   Flash memory units set a record. The average selling price was higher.

     --   Wireless connectivity units set a record.

     --   Application processor units for products such as cellular phones and
          PDAs set a record.

     Digital Enterprise

     To boost server performance, Intel launched its first dual-core, 64-bit
Intel(R) Xeon(R) processor for dual-processor servers, previously code-named
Paxville. The processor includes Hyper-Threading Technology and can increase the
performance of multithreaded applications by as much as 50 percent(1) when
compared to the previous, single-core version. Intel also announced plans to
ship the dual-core 64-bit Intel Xeon processor 7000 sequence for multiprocessor
(MP) servers later in the fourth quarter. New MP server platforms based on the
processor will include the Intel(R) E8501 chipset, which supports an 800 MHz
system bus, a dual independent system bus and DDR2 memory.
     To increase server power efficiency, the company introduced low-voltage
versions of its 64-bit Intel Xeon processors, including a 3 GHz, low-voltage
version that operates in a 55-watt processor power envelope and a 3.2 GHz,
mid-voltage version for use in 90-watt configurations, both targeted at rack and
blade server designs.
     Intel prepared for the volume ramp of new dual-core platforms by launching
a broad evaluation program that will provide thousands of systems to enterprise
customers and software developers, including a dual-core Intel Xeon server
platform code-named Bensley for upcoming processors code-named Dempsey and
Woodcrest. The evaluation program will help developers optimize their
multithreaded applications and allow IT end users to evaluate performance gains,
test compatibility with in-house applications and accelerate deployment plans.
     The Itanium(R) Solutions Alliance was formed by Intel along with Bull,
Fujitsu, Fujitsu Siemens Computers, Hitachi, HP, NEC, SGI and Unisys. This
additional level of collaboration within the Itanium community will further grow
software capabilities and choices for Itanium-based servers.
     For the Digital Office, the company demonstrated how Intel(R)
Virtualization Technology and Intel(R) Active Management Technology can be used
in future business PC designs to help IT managers fight computer viruses by
detecting, isolating and patching infected PCs, thereby protecting the network
and preserving user productivity.
     At the Intel Developer Forum in August, the company unveiled a
next-generation processor microarchitecture that will power the company's future
platforms for the Digital Enterprise, Digital Office, Digital Home and Mobility.
The new microarchitecture combines the power-efficiency associated with the
company's industry-leading notebook PC processors with multicore computing
capability and "(star)T" technologies that help enable 64-bit computing and
improved manageability, reliability and security. The new microarchitecture will
be the foundation of new Intel platforms beginning in the second half of 2006
with the introduction of dual-core processors code-named Woodcrest for server
platforms, Conroe for desktop platforms, and Merom for notebook platforms, all
of which will be manufactured on Intel's 65nm process technology.

     Mobility

     In handheld computing and communications, Research In Motion (RIM)
announced plans to use the Intel's new cellular processor, codenamed Hermon, in
next-generation BlackBerry* devices, which are used on high-speed EDGE wireless
networks to enable users to connect to the Internet and send and receive data
with broadband-like speed. In addition, Motorola announced plans for the Moto Q*
smartphone which uses an Intel application processor code-named Bulverde for
applications including mobile e-mail and Web surfing.
     In notebook computing, Intel announced an agreement with Matsushita Battery
Industrial to develop technology enabling "all-day computing." The company also
said it is working with Crown Castle and DiBcom to demonstrate mobile broadcast
TV functionality on mobile platforms based on Intel(R) Centrino(R) mobile
technology as well as Intel XScale(R) technology.
     To enable future mobile platforms and small-form factor devices that
combine performance and long battery life, Intel announced it is developing an
ultra-low power derivative of its 65nm process technology.
     To further accelerate the deployment of WiMAX wireless broadband networks,
Intel launched the Asian Broadband Campaign which will provide consulting and
expertise along with silicon and technical services. Intel Capital invested in
Unwired Australia, which is quickly moving to WiMAX technology and expanding
wireless broadband services to more cities. Intel now expects 100 WiMAX trials
to be underway worldwide by the end of the year.
     Intel and Cisco Systems announced plans to enhance the quality and
reliability of wireless LANs and allow enterprises to use computers and the
network as a combined defense against security threats. In 2006, the companies
plan to deliver a new set of features called Business Class Wireless Suite that
will allow Intel Centrino mobile technology-based clients to scan for the best
access point within a business wireless LAN and provide enhanced Voice over IP
services and technologies for notebook PCs.
     To advance the bandwidth available from Wi-Fi networks, Intel and other
industry leaders formed the Enhanced Wireless Consortium. The companies will
enable an ecosystem of a new generation of interoperable, high-performance
wireless LAN products with the goal of accelerating the development of the IEEE
802.11n standard. Intel also launched the Digital Communities initiative and is
working with a diverse group of high-tech companies to help communities use
wireless technology and new applications to enhance government efficiency,
promote economic growth, foster greater community satisfaction and bridge the
digital divide.

     Digital Home

     As part of its strategy to deliver technology tailored to the needs of
consumers, Intel announced plans to deliver platforms with a new Intel(R)
Viiv(TM) technology brand name. PCs with Intel Viiv technology will include
remote controls and work with a variety of Intel-verified online services and
software, including movies, music, photos and games. Designed from the ground up
for the digital home, Intel Viiv technology will include a suite of Intel
ingredients including a dual-core processor, chipset, platform software and
networking capabilities. Systems based on the first versions of the new platform
will be available in the first quarter of 2006 in a variety of form factors and
designs.
     Intel is also developing platforms to power consumer electronics (CE)
devices such as digital televisions, set-top boxes and digital media recorders.
Intel announced the Oplus(TM) MN301 "system-on-a-chip" multimedia display
processor for flat panel displays and HDTV monitors. The company also announced
its intention to acquire demodulator and tuner technologies as well as expertise
from Zarlink Semiconductor that comprise the "front end" of such CE devices,
enabling them to receive, process, display and store digital broadcast signals.

     Technology and Manufacturing

     Intel has initiated commercial production and revenue shipments of
dual-core microprocessors based on the company's industry-leading 65nm, 300mm
process technology, which enables cost-effective, high-volume manufacturing of
multicore microprocessors and other advanced products. Intel expects to ship
hundreds of thousands of processors built on 65nm technology by the end of the
year and is broadly sampling dual-core processors code-named Yonah, Presler and
Dempsey to its OEM customers in preparation for a high-volume ramp in 2006.
     The company began construction of Fab 32, a new 300mm wafer fabrication
facility in Chandler, Ariz. The $3 billion factory is scheduled to begin
production of leading-edge microprocessors in the second half of 2007 on a 45nm
process technology.
     The company also announced plans to invest $345 million to expand capacity
at Fab 23 in Colorado Springs, Colo. and Fab 17 in Hudson, Mass. The 200mm
facilities are being used to produce products such as chipsets and
communications devices for a variety of Intel platforms. Intel also plans to
invest $105 million to convert an inactive fabrication facility in Rio Rancho,
N.M. for use as a product testing facility.

     EARNINGS WEBCAST

     Intel will hold a public webcast at 2:30 p.m. PDT today on its Investor
Relations Web site at www.intc.com. A replay of the webcast will be available
until Jan. 17.

     STATUS OF BUSINESS OUTLOOK AND MID-QUARTER BUSINESS UPDATE

     During the quarter, Intel's corporate representatives may reiterate the
Business Outlook during private meetings with investors, investment analysts,
the media and others. Intel intends to publish a Mid-Quarter Business Update on
Dec. 8. From the close of business on Dec. 2 until publication of the Update,
Intel will observe a "Quiet Period" during which the Business Outlook disclosed
in the company's press releases and filings with the SEC on Forms 10-K and 10-Q

only and not subject to update by the company. For more information about the
Business Outlook, Update and related Quiet Periods, please refer to the Business
Outlook section of Intel's Web site at www.intc.com.

     RISK FACTORS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

     The statements in this document that refer to plans and expectations for
the fourth quarter, the year and the future are forward-looking statements that
involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Many factors could affect Intel's
actual results, and variances from Intel's current expectations regarding such
factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in
these forward-looking statements. Intel presently considers the factors
accompanying certain of such statements above and set forth below to be the
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
Intel's published expectations. A more detailed discussion of these factors, as
well as other factors that could affect Intel's results, is contained in Intel's
SEC filings, including the report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 2,
2005.

     --   Intel operates in intensely competitive industries. Revenue and the
          gross margin percentage are affected by the demand for and market
          acceptance of Intel's products, the availability of sufficient
          inventory to meet demand, pricing pressures and actions taken by
          Intel's competitors. Factors that could cause demand to be different
          from Intel's expectations include changes in customer order patterns,
          including order cancellations; changes in the level of inventory at
          customers; and changes in business and economic conditions.

     --   Gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other could
          vary from expectations depending on equity market levels and
          volatility; gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of
          securities; impairment charges related to marketable, non-marketable
          and other investments; interest rates; cash balances; and changes in
          fair value of derivative instruments.

     --   Intel's results could be impacted by unexpected economic, social and
          political conditions in the countries in which Intel, its customers or
          its suppliers operate, including security risks, possible
          infrastructure disruptions and fluctuations in foreign currency
          exchange rates.

     --   Intel's results could also be affected by adverse effects associated
          with product defects and errata (deviations from published
          specifications), and by litigation or regulatory matters involving
          intellectual property, stockholder, consumer, antitrust and other
          issues, such as the litigation and regulatory matters described in
          Intel's SEC reports.

     Intel, the world's largest chip maker, is also a leading manufacturer of
computer, networking and communications products. Additional information about

During the first quarter of 2005, the company reorganized its business
groups to bring all major product groups in line with the company's
strategy to design and deliver technology platforms. These new
business units include the Digital Enterprise Group, the Mobility
Group, the Digital Home Group, the Digital Health Group and the
Channel Platforms Group. The Digital Enterprise Group and the Mobility
group are reportable operating segments. The Digital Home Group,
Digital Health Group and Channel Platforms Group operating segments do
not meet the quantitative thresholds for reportable segments as
defined by SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information." Therefore, these operating segments are
included within the "all other" category. All prior period amounts
have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect the new organizational
structure as well as certain minor reorganizations effected through
the third quarter of 2005. As a result of this platform
reorganization, further changes may occur in the future.

The Digital Enterprise Group operating segment's products include
microprocessors and related chipsets and motherboards designed for the
desktop (including consumer desktop) and enterprise computing market
segments, communications infrastructure components such as network
processors and embedded microprocessors, wired connectivity devices
and products for network and server storage. The Mobility Group
operating segment's products include microprocessors and related
chipsets designed for the mobile computing market segment, flash
memory, wireless connectivity products, application processors used in
cellular handsets and handheld computing devices, and cellular
baseband chipsets. Revenue for the "all other" category primarily
consists of microprocessors and related chipsets used in consumer
electronics devices. For further information on the business strategy
of each operating segment, see Intel's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
for the quarter ended July 2, 2005.

In October 2005, Intel entered into a legal settlement agreement with
MicroUnity, Inc. and recorded an estimated $140 million charge to
third-quarter results. Of this amount, $110 million reduced the
operating income of the Digital Enterprise Group, and $30 million
reduced the operating income of the Mobility Group.

In addition to the operating results for the Digital Home Group,
Digital Health Group and Channel Platforms Group operating segments,
