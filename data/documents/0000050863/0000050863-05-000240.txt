Item 2.03   Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an
            Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of
            a Registrant.

Item 3.02   Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

Item 8.01   Other Events.

           Although the company is filing the below information
           regarding the creation of a direct financial
           obligation under Item 2.03 on Form 8-K, the company
           does not believe and this filing is not an admission
           that the direct financial obligation reported hereby
           is material to the company.   In addition, the
           company is filing the below information under Item
           3.02 although the number of shares of common stock of
           the company initially issuable upon conversion of the
           below described debentures constitutes less than 1%
           of the number of shares outstanding of the common
           stock of the company.

           On December 13, 2005, the company agreed to sell to
           an initial purchaser an offering of $1.4 billion
           principal amount of 2.95% junior subordinated
           convertible debentures due December 15, 2035.  The
           company granted the initial purchaser an option to
           purchase up to an additional $200 million principal
           amount of debentures, which option was exercised on
           December 14, 2005.  The initial purchaser will sell
           the debentures solely to qualified institutional
           buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act
           of 1933, as amended.  The sale of $1.6 billion
           principal amount of debentures closed on December 16,
           2005.  The aggregate offering price of the debentures
           was $1.6 billion and the aggregate initial
           purchaser's discount was $17,250,000.

           The debentures will be initially convertible, subject
           to certain conditions, into shares of the company's
           common stock at a conversion rate of 31.7162 shares
           of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of
           debentures, representing an initial effective
           conversion price of approximately $31.53 per share.
           The initial conversion price represents a premium of
           18% to the closing price of the company's common
           stock on December 13, 2005, which was $26.72 per
           share.  The conversion rate will be subject to
           adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted
           for accrued interest.  In addition, the conversion
           rate will increase for a holder who elects to convert
           its debentures in connection with certain fundamental
           changes.

           The debentures will pay interest semiannually through
           maturity and will be convertible upon the occurrence
           of specified events into shares of the company's
           common stock.  In addition to regular interest,
           beginning on December 15, 2010, contingent interest
           will accrue during any interest period in which the
           average trading price of a debenture for specified
           periods is greater than or equal to $1,300 per $1,000
           principal amount of the debentures or is less than or
           equal to a threshold initially

<PAGE>
	   set at $800 per $1,000
           principal amount of the debentures and that will
           increase over time.  The company may also defer the
           payment of interest on the debentures for a period
           not exceeding 10 consecutive semi-annual interest
           periods for so long as the company is not in default
           in the payment of interest on the debentures.

           The debentures will be redeemable at the company's
           option at any time on or after December 15, 2012 for
           cash at a redemption price of 100% of the principal
           amount of the debentures, plus accrued but unpaid
           interest, if the price of a share of the company's
           common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion
           price then in effect for specified periods.   Holders
           may require the company to repurchase all or a
           portion of the debentures for cash at a purchase
           price of 100% of the principal amount of the
           debentures, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon
           certain events constituting a fundamental change.  In
           addition, on or prior to June 12, 2006, the company
           may redeem all or part of the debentures for cash at
           a premium if certain U.S. federal tax legislation,
           regulations or rules are enacted or are issued.

           The debentures are the company's unsecured junior
           obligations subordinated in right of payment to the
           company's existing and future senior debt and
           effectively subordinated in right of payment to all
           indebtedness and other liabilities of the company's
           subsidiaries.
