Item 2.02         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                  Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference
                  herein is financial information for Intel Corporation for the
                  fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 and
                  forward-looking statements relating to 2006 and the first
                  quarter of 2006 as presented in a press release of January 17,
                  2006.

                  Also included in Exhibit 99.1 under the heading "Supplemental
                  Operating Segment Results and Other Information" is certain
                  unaudited annual and quarterly financial information for the
                  company's operating segments, presented on a basis that
                  reflects the revised operating segments of the company
                  effective as of the fourth quarter of 2005. The Flash Memory
                  Group, which had previously been part of the Mobility Group,
                  became a separate operating segment in the fourth quarter. The
                  historical financial information presented under the new
                  organizational structure does not in any way restate or revise
                  the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of
                  Intel Corporation as set forth in any previously reported
                  consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of income
                  or consolidated statement of cash flows of the company. This
                  information is provided as supplemental financial information
                  that may be of interest to Intel Corporation stockholders.

                  The information in this report shall be deemed incorporated by
                  reference into any registration statement heretofore or
                  hereafter filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
                  except to the extent that such information is superseded by
                  information as of a subsequent date that is included in or
                  incorporated by reference into such registration statement.
                  The information in this report shall not be treated as filed
                  for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
                  amended.

                  In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in
                  accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
                  (GAAP), the Business Outlook statements in the company's
                  earnings release contain non-GAAP financial measures that
                  exclude the effects of share-based compensation expense and
                  the requirements of SFAS No. 123(R), "Share-based Payment"
                  ("123R"). Commencing with its first quarter 2006 earnings
                  release, the company's earnings releases will include non-GAAP
                  financial measures of its financial results for the reporting
                  period that exclude the income statement effects of
                  share-based compensation and the effects of 123R upon the
                  number of diluted shares used in calculating non-GAAP earnings
                  per share. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the
                  company should not be considered a substitute for or superior
                  to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and
                  the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and
                  reconciliations to those financial statements should be
                  carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measures used by
                  the company may be calculated differently from, and therefore
                  may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by
                  other companies. The company has provided reconciliations of
                  the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly
                  comparable GAAP financial measures.

<PAGE>

                  The company will apply the modified prospective method of
                  adoption of 123R, under which the effects of 123R will be
                  reflected in the company's GAAP financial statement
                  presentations for and after the first quarter 2006, but will
                  not be reflected in results for prior periods. Gross margin,
                  expenses (research and development and marketing, general and
                  administrative), operating income, income taxes, net income
                  and earnings per share (EPS) are the primary financial
                  measures management uses for planning and forecasting future
                  periods that are affected by shared-based compensation.
                  Because management will continue to review these financial
                  measures calculated without taking into account the effects of
                  the new requirements under 123R, upon implementation of 123R
                  these financial measures are treated as "non-GAAP financial
                  measures" under Securities and Exchange Commission rules.
                  Management uses the non-GAAP financial measures for internal
                  managerial purposes, including as a means to compare
                  period-to-period results on both a segment basis and
                  consolidated basis and as a means to evaluate the company's
                  results on a consolidated basis compared to those of other
                  companies. In addition, management uses certain of these
                  measures when publicly providing forward-looking statements on
                  expectations regarding future consolidated basis financial
                  results as in the document attached to this Form 8-K.

                  The company's share-based compensation programs are
                  established and managed on a corporate-wide basis, including
                  specification of grant types and amount ranges for employees
                  by category and grade. Following implementation of 123R,
                  segment managers will not be held accountable for share-based
                  compensation charges impacting their business unit's operating
                  income (loss) and accordingly share-based compensation charges
                  will be excluded from the company's measure of segment
                  profitability (operating income). Therefore, the review of
                  segment results by management and the Board of Directors will
                  exclude share-based compensation.

                  Additionally, management and the Board of Directors will
                  continue to compare the company's historical consolidated
                  results of operations (revenue, gross margin, research and
                  development, marketing, general and administrative expenses,
                  operating income as well as net income and EPS), excluding
                  stock-based compensation, to financial information prepared on
                  the same basis during the company's budget and planning
                  process, to assess the business and to compare consolidated
                  results to the objectives identified for the company. The
                  company's budget and planning process commences with a
                  segment-level evaluation - which, as noted above, excludes
                  share-based compensation - and culminates with the preparation
                  of a consolidated annual and/or quarterly budget that includes
                  these non-GAAP financial measures (gross margin, research and
                  development expenses, marketing, general and administrative
                  expenses, operating income, income tax expense, net income and
                  EPS). This budget, once finalized and approved, serves as the
                  basis for allocation of resources and management of
                  operations. While share-based compensation is a significant
                  expense affecting the company's results of operations,
                  management excludes share-based compensation from the
                  company's consolidated budget and planning process to
                  facilitate period to period comparisons and to assess changes
                  in gross margin dollar, net income and earnings per share
                  targets in relation to changes in forecast revenue.

<PAGE>


                  The company discloses this information to the public to enable
                  investors who wish to more easily assess the company's
                  performance on the same basis applied by management and to
                  ease comparison on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis among other
                  companies, that separately identify share-based compensation
                  expenses. In particular, as the company begins to apply 123R,
                  the company believes that it is useful to investors to
                  understand how the expenses and other adjustments associated
                  with the application of 123R are being reflected on the
                  company's income statements.

                  Although these non-GAAP financial measures adjust expense
                  and diluted share items to exclude the accounting treatment
                  of share-based compensation, they should not be viewed as a
                  pro-forma presentation reflecting the elimination of the
                  underlying share-based compensation programs, as those
                  programs are an important element of the company's
                  compensation structure and generally accepted accounting
                  principles indicate that all forms of share-based payments
                  should be valued and included as appropriate in results of
                  operations. Management compensates for this aspect of the
                  non-GAAP financial measures by evaluating the dilutive
                  effect of the company's share-based compensation
                  arrangements on the company's basic and diluted earnings per
                  share calculations and by reviewing other quantitative and
                  qualitative information regarding the company's share-based
                  compensation arrangements, including the information
                  provided in the Management's Discussion and Analysis section
                  of the company's quarterly and annual financial reports
                  under the caption "Employee Equity Incentive Plans."

Intel Fourth-Quarter Revenue $10.2 Billion; EPS 40 Cents; Record Quarterly and
Annual Revenue and Operating Income; Record Quarterly Unit Shipments of Mobile,
Desktop and Server Microprocessors

     SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 17, 2006--Intel Corporation
today announced fourth-quarter revenue of $10.2 billion, operating income of
$3.3 billion, net income of $2.5 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of 40
cents. Revenue was below the company's updated expectation of $10.4 billion to
$10.6 billion primarily due to lower than expected desktop processor unit
shipments and prices.
     "2005 was our third consecutive year of double-digit revenue and earnings
growth, leading to the best operating results in the company's history," said
Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini. "Although we fell below our expectations
for the fourth quarter, we enter 2006 with exciting new products like the
Intel(R) Core(TM) Duo and Viiv(TM). Our industry-leading 65nm process technology
is ramping dual-core processors into high volume with an expected crossover in
performance segments by mid-year. We expect 2006 will be another year of growth
for Intel as we ramp platforms for notebooks, the digital home, the digital
office and emerging markets."


                    Q4 2005            vs. Q3 2005     vs. Q4 2004
- ------------------- ------------------ --------------- ---------------
Revenue             $10.2 billion      +2%             +6%
Operating Income    $3.3 billion       +7%             +14%
Net Income          $2.5 billion       +23%            +16%
EPS                 40 cents           +25%            +21%
- ------------------- ------------------ --------------- ---------------
Note: Results for the third quarter of 2005 included a tax item and
 legal settlement that together lowered EPS by 6 cents.


     For 2005, Intel achieved record revenue of $38.8 billion, record operating
income of $12.1 billion, net income of $8.7 billion and EPS of $1.40. Intel paid
record cash dividends of nearly $2 billion and used a record $10.6 billion to
repurchase 418.4 million shares of common stock.


                    2005               2004            Change
- ------------------- ------------------ --------------- ---------------
Revenue             $38.8 billion      $34.2 billion   + 13.5%
Operating Income    $12.1 billion      $10.1 billion   + 19%
Net Income          $8.7 billion       $7.5 billion    + 15%
EPS                 $1.40              $1.16           + 21%


     Financial Review

     Fourth-quarter gross margin was 61.8 percent, slightly below the company's
updated expectation of 63 percent, plus or minus a point, primarily due to lower
than expected revenue, a slight shift in the overall product mix to
non-microprocessor products, and some inventory valuation adjustments to reflect
lower unit costs. The effective tax rate of 29.1 percent was below the expected
rate of 31 percent primarily due to tax benefits for export sales and estimated
R&D tax credits.

     Sales Patterns

     Revenue in the company's Asia Pacific region was essentially flat
sequentially while revenue in the Americas region was sequentially lower. These
results primarily reflect lower than expected demand for our desktop products
among certain OEM customers.


                    Q4 2005            vs. Q3 2005     vs. Q4 2004
- ------------------- ------------------ --------------- ---------------
Asia-Pacific        $5.1 billion       Flat            +16%
Americas            $1.8 billion       -3.5%           -10%
Europe              $2.3 billion       +14%            Flat
Japan               $945 million       +2%             +11%


     Key Product Trends (Sequential)

     Business Outlook and Risk Factors Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

     The following expectations do not include the potential impact of any
mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other business combinations that may be
completed after Jan. 16. Intel is adding additional items to its full-year
Business Outlook and is discontinuing the practice of making scheduled
mid-quarter Business Updates.

     2006 Outlook

     --   Revenue: Expected to be 6 percent to 9 percent higher than $38.8
          billion in 2005.

     --   Gross margin: 57 percent, plus or minus a few points (58 percent, plus
          or minus a few points, excluding share-based compensation effects of
          approximately 1 percent).

     --   R&D: Approximately $6.5 billion (approximately $6 billion excluding

     --   Expenses (R&D plus MG&A): Approximately $3.3 billion (approximately $3

     --   Tax rate: Approximately 32 percent.

     --   Depreciation: $1.1 billion, plus or minus $100 million.

     --   Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs:
          Approximately $20 million.

     The above statements and any others in this document that refer to plans
and expectations for the first quarter, the year and the future involve a number
of risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause Intel's actual results to
differ materially from current expectations, including the following:

     --   Intel operates in intensely competitive industries that are
          characterized by a high percentage of costs that are fixed or
          difficult to reduce in the short term, and by product demand that is
          highly variable. Revenue and the gross margin percentage are affected
          by the demand for and market acceptance of Intel's products; the
          availability of sufficient inventory of Intel products and related
          components from other suppliers to meet demand; pricing pressures;
          actions taken by Intel's competitors; and Intel's ability to respond
          quickly to technological developments and to incorporate new features
          into its products. Factors that could cause demand to be different
          from Intel's expectations include changes in customer order patterns,
          including order cancellations; changes in the level of inventory at
          customers; and changes in business and economic conditions.

     --   The gross margin percentage could vary from expectations based on
          changes in revenue levels; product mix and pricing; variations in
          inventory valuation, including variations related to the timing of
          qualifying products for sale; excess or obsolete inventory;
          manufacturing yields; changes in unit costs; capacity utilization;
          impairments of long-lived assets, including manufacturing,
          assembly/test and intangible assets; and the timing and execution of
          the manufacturing ramp and associated costs, including start-up costs.

     --   Dividend declarations and the dividend rate are at the discretion of
          Intel's board of directors, and plans for future dividends may be
          revised by the board. Intel's dividend and stock buyback programs
          could be affected by changes in its capital spending programs, changes
          in its cash flows and changes in tax laws, as well as by the level and
          timing of acquisition and investment activity.

     --   Expenses, particularly certain marketing and compensation expenses,
          vary depending on the level of demand for Intel's products and the
          level of revenue and profits.

     --   The tax rate expectation is based on current tax law and current
          expected income and assumes Intel continues to receive tax benefits
          for export sales. The tax rate may be affected by the closing of
          acquisitions or divestitures; the jurisdictions in which profits are
          determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the estimates of
          credits, benefits and deductions; the resolution of issues arising
          from tax audits with various tax authorities; and the ability to
          realize deferred tax assets.

     --   Gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other could
          vary from expectations depending on equity market levels and
          volatility; gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of
          securities; impairment charges related to marketable, non-marketable
          and other investments; interest rates; cash balances; and changes in
          fair value of derivative instruments.

     --   Intel's results could be impacted by unexpected economic, social and
          political conditions in the countries in which Intel, its customers or
          its suppliers operate, including security risks, possible
          infrastructure disruptions and fluctuations in foreign currency
          exchange rates.

     --   Intel's results could be affected by adverse effects associated with
          product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications),
          and by litigation or regulatory matters involving intellectual
          property, stockholder, consumer, antitrust and other issues, such as
          the litigation and regulatory matters described in Intel's SEC
          reports.

     --   Intel's results could be affected by the amount, type, and valuation
          of share-based awards granted as well as the amount of awards
          cancelled due to employee turnover.

     A more detailed discussion of these and other factors that could affect
results is contained in Intel's SEC filings, including the report on Form 10-Q
for the quarter ended Oct. 1, 2005.

     Status of Business Outlook

     During the quarter, Intel's corporate representatives may reiterate the
Business Outlook during private meetings with investors, investment analysts,
the media and others. From the close of business on March 3 until publication of
the company's first-quarter 2006 earnings release on April 19, Intel will
observe a "Quiet Period" during which the Business Outlook disclosed in the
company's press releases and filings with the SEC on Forms 10-K and 10-Q should
be considered to be historical, speaking as of prior to the Quiet Period only
and not subject to update by the company.

     Earnings Webcast

     Intel will hold a public webcast at 2:30 p.m. PST today on its Investor
Relations Web site at www.intc.com, with a replay available until April 19.

     Intel, the world leader in silicon innovation, develops technologies,

During the first quarter of 2005, the company reorganized its
operating segments to bring all major product groups in line with the
company's strategy to design and deliver technology platforms. The
operating segments after the first quarter reorganization included the
Digital Enterprise Group, the Mobility Group, the Digital Home Group,
the Digital Health Group and the Channel Platforms Group. In the
fourth quarter of 2005, the company added the Flash Memory Group. The
Digital Enterprise Group and the Mobility Group are reportable
operating segments. The Flash Memory Group, Digital Home Group,
Digital Health Group and Channel Platforms Group operating segments do
not meet the quantitative thresholds for reportable segments; however,
the Flash Memory Group is reported separately as management believes
this information is useful to readers. The Digital Home Group, Digital
Health Group and Channel Platforms Group operating segments are
included within the "all other" category. All prior period amounts
have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect the new organizational
structure and certain minor reorganizations effected through the
fourth quarter of 2005.

The Digital Enterprise Group operating segment's products include
microprocessors and related chipsets and motherboards designed for the
desktop (including consumer desktop) and enterprise computing market
segments, communications infrastructure components such as network
processors and embedded microprocessors, wired connectivity devices
and products for network and server storage. The Mobility Group
operating segment's products include microprocessors and related
chipsets designed for the notebook computing market segment, wireless
connectivity products, application and cellular processors used in
cellular handsets and handheld computing devices, and cellular
baseband chipsets. The Flash Memory Group operating segment's products
include NOR flash memory products designed for cellular phones and
embedded form factors. Revenue for the "all other" category primarily
consists of microprocessors and related chipsets sold by the Digital
Home Group.

The "all other" category includes certain corporate-level operating
expenses, including a portion of profit-dependent bonus and other
expenses not allocated to the operating segments. "All other" also
includes the results of operations of seed businesses that support the
company's initiatives. Finally, "all other" includes
acquisition-related costs. In 2003, acquisition-related costs included
a goodwill impairment charge of $611 million.
