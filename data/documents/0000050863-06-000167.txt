Item         Regulation FD Disclosure.
7.01
             In connection with the April 19 and July 19
             Earnings Releases, Intel Corporation (the
             "Corporation") discussed an ongoing program
             designed to improve operational efficiency and
             results.  In connection with that program the
             Corporation has previously announced the planned
             sale of its communications and application
             processor business to Marvell Technology Group, and
             the elimination of approximately 1,000 management
             positions within the Corporation.

             Further with respect to that program, the
             Corporation determined on August 30, 2006 to
             undertake a number of additional actions
             recommended by the Corporation's Structure and
             Efficiency Taskforce relating to organizational
             efficiency, business processes and programs. Some
             of these actions (collectively, the "Efficiency
             Plan") have commenced and will continue for varying
             periods of time, and other actions will involve
             further analysis and execution at a later date.  It
             is intended that most of these actions will have
             commenced or be executed by the end of the 2007
             fiscal year, although some actions may occur or
             continue into the 2008 and 2009 fiscal years.

             The Corporation presently estimates that the
             aggregate result of these actions pursuant to the
             Efficiency Plan will be to reduce cost-of-sales and
             marketing, general and administrative and research
             and development expenses by approximately $2
             billion in 2007 and $3 billion in 2008.  These
             actions are also expected to reduce the
             Corporation's workforce by approximately 10,500
             employees worldwide as of July 1, 2007 relative to
             employment of 102,500 persons as of July 1, 2006.
             Year-end 2006 employment is expected to be
             approximately 95,000 persons. The Corporation also
             expects that several of these actions under the
             Efficiency Plan will result in the avoidance of
             approximately $1 billion in capital expenditures
             that otherwise would have been incurred in 2008.
             The Corporation intends to provide additional
             information concerning the impact of these actions
             on the Corporation's third quarter and the
             estimated impact of these actions on the
             Corporation's fourth quarter with the Corporation's
             2006 third quarter Earnings Release (scheduled for
             publication on October 17, 2006). Similarly,
             additional detail with regard to 2007 will be
             provided in the Corporation's earnings releases and
             Business Outlook statements published quarterly
             during 2007.

             In connection with the Efficiency Plan, the
             Corporation expects to record restructuring charges
             of approximately $200 million no later than 2007.
             Additional, presently undetermined, charges may be
             incurred during the 2008 and 2009 fiscal years. The
             Corporation currently expects that a majority of
             the aggregate charges will be related to employee
             benefit and severance arrangements to be paid

<PAGE>
             in cash.

             The exact timing of these charges and the related
             cash outflows, as well as the estimated cost ranges
             by category type, have not been finalized. This
             information will be subject to the finalization of
             timetables for the transition of functions, local
             labor law requirements, including consultation with
             appropriate works councils as well as the statutory
             severance requirements of the particular legal
             jurisdictions impacted, and the amount and timing
             of the actual charges may vary due to a variety of
             factors including the salary, position and number
             of years of service of the affected employees as
             well as the type and amount of severance benefits
             offered to employees. The Efficiency Plan reflects
             the Corporation's intention only and restructuring
             decisions at certain non-U.S. locations remain
             subject to local labor law requirements, including
             consultation with appropriate works councils.

             Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by
             reference herein is a press release describing the
             Efficiency Plan. The information in this Current
             Report shall be deemed incorporated by reference
             into any registration statement heretofore or
             hereafter filed under the Securities Act of 1933,
             as amended, except to the extent that such
             information is superseded by information as of a
             subsequent date that is included in or incorporated
             by reference into such registration statement. The
             information in this report shall not be treated as
             filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act
             of 1934, as amended.

             This Form 8-K and attached press release contain
             forward-looking statements that involve risks,
             uncertainties and assumptions. Many factors could
             affect the Efficiency Plan and the Corporation's
             actual results, and if the risks or uncertainties
             ever materialize or the assumptions prove
             incorrect, the results of the Corporation may
             differ materially from those expressed or implied
             by such forward-looking statements and assumptions.
             All statements other than statements of historical
             fact are statements that could be deemed forward-
             looking statements, including but not limited to
             any projections, the extent or timing of cost
             savings, charges, use of cost savings, revenue or
             profitability improvements, or other financial
             items; any statements of the plans, strategies, and
             objectives of management for future operations,
             including timing and execution of any restructuring
             plans, retirement programs, benefit program changes
             or reorganizations and extent of employees
             impacted; any statements concerning the
             Corporation's expected competitive position or
             performance; any statements of expectation or
             belief; and any statements of assumptions
             underlying any of the foregoing. Intel presently
             considers the factors set forth below to be the
             important factors that could cause actual results
             to differ materially from the Corporation's

             published expectations: risks, uncertainties and
             assumptions including the timing and execution of

             requirements, including consultation with
             appropriate works councils; assumptions related to
             severance and post-retirement costs; future
             acquisitions, dispositions, investments, new
             business initiatives and changes in product
             roadmap, development and manufacturing which may
             affect expense and employment levels at the
             Corporation; assumptions relating to product demand
             and the business environment; and other risk
             factors that are described from time to time in the
             Corporation's Securities and Exchange Commission
             reports, including but not limited to the risk

                  INTEL ANNOUNCES RESTRUCTURING

         Expects to Reduce Costs and Operating Expenses
          By $2 Billion in 2007, By $3 Billion in 2008

SANTA CLARA, Calif., Sept. 5, 2006 - Intel today announced plans
for restructuring following an analysis of the company's
structure and efficiency. As a result of the restructuring, the
company expects to generate savings in costs and operating
expenses of approximately $2 billion in 2007.  In 2008 the
company expects savings from this restructuring to grow to
approximately $3 billion annually.

     The savings are a combination of non-workforce related steps
and a significant reduction in Intel's workforce. The company's
employee population will decline to approximately 95,000 by the
end of this year, resulting from workforce reductions, attrition
and previously announced actions. The workforce will decline to
approximately 92,000 by the middle of 2007 - 10,500 fewer than
the company's employee population at the end of the second
quarter of 2006. In addition to the savings from the workforce
reduction, the company expects savings in merchandizing expenses,
capital and materials.

     "These actions, while difficult, are essential to Intel
becoming a more agile and efficient company, not just for this
year or the next, but for years to come," said Paul Otellini,
Intel president and chief executive officer.

<PAGE>

     Most job reductions this year will occur in management,
marketing and information technology functions, reductions
related to the previously announced sale of businesses, as well
as attrition. In 2007, the reductions will be more broadly based
as Intel improves labor efficiency in manufacturing, improves
equipment utilization, eliminates organizational redundancies,
and improves product design methods and processes.

     In 2008, the company expects the cost and operating expense
savings from this restructuring to grow to approximately $3
billion as it achieves the full-year run rate on the projects
implemented in 2007. In addition, Intel expects to achieve a
capital expenditure avoidance of $1 billion by better utilizing
manufacturing equipment and space. The company expects that
approximately 25 percent of the project's savings in 2007 will
reduce cost of sales, and the rest will reduce operating
expenses.

     The company expects severance costs to total approximately
$200 million, offsetting some of the expected savings from the
project's implementation.

     Intel is currently in its quiet period, so an update to its
business outlook will not be made at this time. Further
information concerning savings and costs related to the
restructuring project will be provided in quarterly earnings
releases and related business outlook estimates. The earnings
release for the third quarter of this year is scheduled for
publication Oct. 17.

     Intel, the world leader in silicon innovation, develops
technologies, products and initiatives to continually advance how
people work and live. Additional information about Intel is
available at www.intel.com/pressroom.

This press release contains forward-looking statements that
involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Many factors could
affect the Efficiency Plan and the Corporation's actual results,
and if the risks or uncertainties ever materialize or the
assumptions prove incorrect, the results of the Corporation may
differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-
looking statements and assumptions. All statements other than
statements of historical fact are statements that could be deemed
forward-looking statements, including but not limited to any
projections, the extent or timing of cost savings, charges, use
of cost savings, revenue or profitability improvements, or other
financial items; any statements of the plans, strategies, and
objectives of management for future operations, including timing
and execution of any restructuring plans, retirement programs,
benefit program changes or reorganizations and extent of
employees impacted; any statements concerning the Corporation's
expected competitive position or performance; any statements of
expectation or belief; and any statements of assumptions
underlying any of the foregoing. Intel presently considers the
factors set forth below to be the important factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from the Corporation's
published expectations: risks, uncertainties and assumptions
including the timing and execution of plans and programs subject
to local labor law requirements, including consultation with
appropriate works councils; assumptions related to severance and
post-retirement costs; future acquisitions, dispositions,
investments, new business initiatives and changes in product
roadmap, development and manufacturing which may affect expense
and employment levels at the Corporation; assumptions relating to
product demand and the business environment; and other risk
factors that are described from time to time in the Corporation's
Securities and Exchange Commission reports, including but not
limited to the risk factors described in the Corporation's
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July
1, 2006, and other reports filed after the Corporation's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005.
