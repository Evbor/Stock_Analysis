           Intel Second-Quarter Business at High End of Expectations;
          Revenue Expected to be Between $9.1 Billion and $9.3 Billion

     SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 9, 2005--Intel Corporation
expects revenue for the second quarter to be between $9.1 billion and $9.3
billion, as compared to the previous range of $8.6 billion to $9.2 billion,
primarily driven by ongoing strong demand for notebook products.
     The second-quarter gross margin percentage is expected to be approximately
57 percent, plus or minus a point, as compared to the previous expectation of 56
percent, plus or minus a couple of points. Gains from equity investments and
interest and other are expected to be approximately $100 million, higher than
the previous expectation of approximately $70 million.
     Intel's tax rate for the second quarter is expected to be 26 percent, plus
or minus a point, as compared to the previous expectation of approximately 31
percent, primarily due to an increase in estimated research and development tax
credits. The tax rate for the third and fourth quarters is expected to be
slightly lower than the previous expectation of approximately 31 percent. All
other expectations are unchanged.
     This Business Update is a scheduled update to the company's Business
Outlook for the quarter, which ends July 2. Intel's second-quarter Business
Outlook was originally published in the company's first-quarter 2005 earnings
release, available at www.intc.com. The company will discuss this update during
a public webcast at 2:30 p.m. PDT today at www.intc.com, with a replay available
until July 19.
     Intel, the world's largest chip maker, is also a leading manufacturer of
computer, networking and communications products. Additional information about
Intel is available at www.intel.com/pressroom.

     This Business Update and the April 19 Business Outlook are forward-looking
statements and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. This Business Update
does not include the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures
or other business combinations that may be completed after June 8, 2005. Many
factors could affect Intel's actual results, and changes from Intel's current
expectations regarding such factors could cause actual results to differ
materially. Intel presently considers the factors set forth below to be the
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
Intel's published expectations. A more detailed discussion of these factors, as
well as other factors that could affect Intel's results, is contained in Intel's
SEC filings, including the report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 2.

     --   Intel operates in intensely competitive industries. Revenue and the
          gross margin percentage are affected by the demand for and market
          acceptance of Intel's products, the availability of sufficient
          inventory to meet demand, pricing pressures and actions taken by
          Intel's competitors, and the timing of new product introductions.
          Factors that could cause demand to be different from Intel's
          expectations include changes in customer order patterns, including
          order cancellations; changes in the level of inventory at customers;
          and changes in business and economic conditions.

     --   The gross margin percentage could vary from expectations based on
          changes in revenue levels, product mix and pricing; manufacturing
          yields; changes in unit costs; variations in inventory valuation;
          excess or obsolete inventory; capacity utilization and the existence
          of excess capacity; impairments of long-lived assets, including
          manufacturing, assembly/test and intangible assets; and the timing and
          execution of the manufacturing ramp and associated costs, including
          start-up costs.

     --   Expenses, particularly certain marketing and compensation expenses,
          vary depending on the level of demand for Intel's products and the
          level of revenue and profits.

     --   The tax rate expectation does not reflect the impact of any potential
          repatriation of cash under the American Jobs Creation Act. The tax
          rate expectation is based on current tax law and current expected
          income and assumes Intel continues to receive tax benefits for export
          sales. The tax rate may be affected by the closing of acquisitions or
          divestitures; the jurisdiction in which profits are determined to be
          earned and taxed; changes in the estimates of credits, benefits and
          deductions; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with
          various tax authorities; and the ability to realize deferred tax
          assets.

     --   Gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other could
          vary from expectations depending on equity market levels and
          volatility; gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of
          securities; impairment charges related to marketable, non-marketable
          and other investments; interest rates; cash balances; and changes in
          fair value of derivative instruments.

     --   Intel's results could be impacted by unexpected economic, social and
          political conditions in the countries in which Intel, its customers or
          its suppliers operate, including security risks, possible
          infrastructure disruptions and fluctuations in foreign currency
          exchange rates.

     --   Intel's results could also be affected by adverse effects associated
          with product defects and errata (deviations from published
          specifications), and by litigation or regulatory matters involving
          intellectual property, stockholder, consumer, antitrust and other
          issues, such as the litigation and regulatory matters described in
          Intel's SEC reports.
