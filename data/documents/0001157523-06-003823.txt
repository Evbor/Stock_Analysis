Item 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

          Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein
          is financial information for Intel Corporation for the quarter ended
          April 1, 2006 and forward-looking statements relating to 2006 and the
          second quarter of 2006 as presented in a press release of April 19,
          2006. The information in this report shall be deemed incorporated by
          reference into any registration statement heretofore or hereafter
          filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except to the
          extent that such information is superseded by information as of a
          subsequent date that is included in or incorporated by reference into
          such registration statement. The information in this report shall not
          be treated as filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of
          1934, as amended.


          In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance
          with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the
          company's earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures that
          exclude the effects of share-based compensation and the requirements
          of SFAS No. 123(R), "Share-based Payment" ("123R"). The non-GAAP
          financial measures used by management and disclosed by the company
          exclude the income statement effects of all forms of share-based
          compensation and the effects of 123R upon the number of diluted shares
          used in calculating non-GAAP earnings per share. The non-GAAP
          financial measures disclosed by the company should not be considered a
          substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in
          accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in
          accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements
          should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measures used by
          the company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not
          be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.
          The company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial
          measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

          The company applied the modified prospective method of adoption of
          123R, under which the effects of 123R are reflected in the company's
          GAAP financial statement presentations for and after the first quarter
          2006, but are not reflected in results for prior periods. Gross
          margin, expenses (research and development and marketing, general and
          administrative), operating income, income taxes, net income and
          earnings per share (EPS) are the primary financial measures management
          uses for planning and forecasting future periods that are affected by
          shared-based compensation. Because management reviews these financial
          measures calculated without taking into account the effects of the new
          requirements under 123R, these financial measures are treated as
          "non-GAAP financial measures" under Securities and Exchange Commission
          rules. Management uses the non-GAAP financial measures for internal
          managerial purposes, including as a means to compare period-to-period
          results on both a segment basis and consolidated basis and as a means
          to evaluate the company's results on a consolidated basis compared to
          those of other companies. In addition, management uses certain of
          these measures when publicly providing forward-looking statements on
          expectations regarding future consolidated basis financial results.

          The company's share-based compensation programs are established and
          managed on a corporate-wide basis, including specification of grant
          types and amount ranges for employees by category and grade. Segment
          managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation charges
          impacting their business unit's operating income (loss) and
          accordingly share-based compensation charges have been excluded from
          the company's measure of segment profitability (operating income).
          Therefore, the review of segment results by management and the Board
          of Directors excludes share-based compensation.


                                       2
<PAGE>


          Additionally, management and the Board of Directors will continue to
          compare the company's historical consolidated results of operations
          (revenue, gross margin, research and development, marketing, general
          and administrative expenses, operating income as well as net income
          and EPS), excluding stock-based compensation, to financial information
          prepared on the same basis during the company's budget and planning
          process, to assess the business and to compare consolidated results to
          the objectives identified for the company. The company's budget and
          planning process commences with a segment-level evaluation - which as
          noted above excludes share-based compensation - and culminates with
          the preparation of a consolidated annual and/or quarterly budget that
          includes these non-GAAP financial measures (gross margin, research and
          development expenses, marketing, general and administrative expenses,
          operating income, income tax expense, net income and EPS). This
          budget, once finalized and approved, serves as the basis for
          allocation of resources and management of operations. While
          share-based compensation is a significant expense affecting the
          company's results of operations, management excludes share-based
          compensation from the company's consolidated budget and planning
          process to facilitate period to period comparisons and to assess
          changes in gross margin dollar, net income and earnings per share
          targets in relation to changes in forecast revenue.

          Profit-dependent cash incentive pay to employees, including senior
          management, also is calculated using formulae that incorporate the
          company's annual results (operating income and/or EPS) excluding
          share-based compensation expense. For example, for 2006 the executive
          compensation cash incentive plan formula measures EPS as the greater
          of (x) Intel's operating income or (y) Intel's net income divided by
          Intel's weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, in both
          cases excluding the effects of share-based compensation.


          The company discloses this information to the public to enable
          investors who wish to more easily assess the company's performance on
          the same basis applied by management and to ease comparison on both a
          GAAP and non-GAAP basis among other companies that separately identify
          share-based compensation expenses. In particular, as the company
          begins to apply 123R, the company believes that it is useful to
          investors to understand how the expenses and other adjustments
          associated with the application of 123R are being reflected on the
          company's income statements.

          Although these non-GAAP financial measures adjust expense, and diluted
          share items to exclude the accounting treatment of share-based
          compensation, they should not be viewed as a pro-forma presentation
          reflecting the elimination of the underlying share-based compensation
          programs, as those programs are an important element of the company's
          compensation structure and generally accepted accounting principles
          indicate that all forms of share-based payments should be valued and
          included as appropriate in results of operations. Management takes
          into consideration this aspect of the non-GAAP financial measures by
          evaluating the dilutive effect of the company's share-based
          compensation arrangements on the company's basic and diluted earnings
          per share calculations and by reviewing other quantitative and
          qualitative information regarding the company's share-based
          compensation arrangements, including the information provided in the
          Management's Discussion and Analysis section of the company's
          quarterly and annual financial reports under the caption "Employee
          Equity Incentive Plans."

               Intel First-Quarter Revenue $8.9 Billion

    SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 19, 2006--Intel
Corporation:

    --  Operating income $1.7 billion ($2.1 billion excluding
        share-based compensation)

    --  EPS 23 cents (27 cents excluding share-based compensation)

    --  $585 million in cash dividends

    --  $2.9 billion used to repurchase 138.5 million shares

    Intel Corporation today announced first-quarter revenue of $8.9
billion, operating income of $1.7 billion, net income of $1.3 billion
and earnings per share (EPS) of 23 cents. Excluding the effects of
share-based compensation, the company posted operating income of $2.1
billion, net income of $1.6 billion and EPS of 27 cents.
    "We believe PC growth rates have moderated over the course of the
past few quarters, leading to slower chip-level inventory reductions
at our customers and affecting our revenue in the first half of the
year," said Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini. "We made excellent
operational progress during the quarter, shipping millions of 65nm
dual-core processors, and saw strong market acceptance of the
Centrino(TM) Duo mobile platform as well as the Viiv(TM) platform for
the digital home. We plan to launch new processors based on the
Intel(R) Core(TM) microarchitecture in the third quarter, giving Intel
performance leadership across the server, desktop and mobile segments
and setting the stage for a strong second half."

    Financial Review

    First-quarter gross margin was 55.1 percent, versus a January
expectation of 59 percent, plus or minus a couple of points. Gross
margin was impacted by lower microprocessor revenue and higher
inventory write-downs. Expenses (R&D plus MG&A) were $3.2 billion,
versus a January expectation of $3.3 billion due to lower revenue- and
profit-related spending. The effective tax rate was 27.5 percent,
versus a January expectation of approximately 32 percent. The decrease
was primarily driven by a higher percentage of profits in low-tax
jurisdictions and an increase in non-U.S. R&D tax credits that
together increased earnings by approximately 1.4 cents per share.

    Key Product Trends (Sequential)

    --  Total microprocessor units were lower. The average selling
        price (ASP) was slightly lower.

    --  Chipset, motherboard and flash memory units were lower.

    --  Application processor units for products such as cellular
        phones and PDAs were lower.

    Sales Patterns

    Sequential revenue in the Asia-Pacific, Americas and Europe
regions was below the company's expectations while the Japan region
achieved its first billion-dollar quarter driven primarily by ongoing
strength in the notebook market segment.

    Recent Highlights

    --  Intel ramped its 65nm process technology into high volume,
        shipping millions of dual-core, 65nm processors into the
        mobile, desktop and server market segments. The company also
        began delivering a new server platform, code-named Bensley,
        that will enable customers to ship servers based on new
        dual-core processors code-named Dempsey and Woodcrest.

    --  The company discussed details of the Intel Core
        microarchitecture, a processor technology that will be used to
        bring industry-leading, energy-efficient performance to
        server, desktop and mobile platforms in the third quarter.

    --  Intel demonstrated a new mobile platform technology code-named
        Robson that works with NAND flash memories to help reduce
        mobile PC boot-up time, increase application performance and
        prolong battery life. Intel also began shipping NAND flash
        memories for revenue and delivered customer samples of the
        industry's first NOR flash memories made using 65nm process
        technology.

    --  Intel produced the industry's first fully functional SRAM
        memories using 45nm process technology, demonstrating that the
        company is on track to be the first chipmaker to produce
        microprocessors on 45nm technology in 2007.

    --  The company launched its Discover the PC initiative which is
        helping to make uncompromised PC technology affordable to
        first-time computer users in emerging markets. Intel also
        announced plans to train an additional 10 million teachers in
        developing nations over the next five years, and made new
        investments designed to expand the company's business
        opportunities in emerging markets around the world.

    Business Outlook and Risk Factors Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements

    The following expectations do not include the potential impact of
any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other business combinations
that may be completed after April 18.

    Q2 2006 Outlook

    --  Revenue: Expected to be between $8.0 billion and $8.6 billion,
        below normal seasonal patterns. The company believes PC growth
        rates have moderated in recent quarters, resulting in
        above-normal customer inventory levels that are limiting
        demand in the short term.

    --  Gross margin: 49 percent, plus or minus a couple of points (50
        percent, plus or minus a couple of points, excluding
        share-based compensation effects of approximately 1 percent).
        The expected reduction in the gross margin percentage from
        first-quarter levels is primarily due to a higher proportion
        of lower-margin product in the overall mix along with higher
        microprocessor unit costs and lower microprocessor ASPs.

    --  Expenses (R&D plus MG&A): Between $3 billion and $3.1 billion
        (between $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion excluding share-based
        compensation effects of approximately $300 million).

    --  Gains from equity investments and interest and other:
        Approximately $175 million.

    --  Tax rate: Approximately 30.5 percent.

    --  Depreciation: Between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion.

    --  Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs:
        Approximately $10 million.

    --  In accordance with internal cash management policies, the
        company expects to significantly reduce the rate of share
        repurchases in upcoming quarters relative to the first-quarter
        rate.

    Revised 2006 Outlook

    The previous Business Outlook for 2006 can be found in the
company's fourth-quarter 2005 earnings release, available at
www.intc.com.

    --  2006 Revenue: Expected to be approximately 3 percent lower
        than prior-year revenue of $38.8 billion, subject to a wide
        range of potential variability.

    --  Gross margin: 53 percent, plus or minus a few points (54
        percent, plus or minus a few points, excluding share-based
        compensation effects of approximately 1 percent).

    --  R&D: Approximately $6.1 billion (approximately $5.6 billion
        excluding share-based compensation effects of approximately
        $500 million).

    --  MG&A: Approximately $6 billion (approximately $5.4 billion
        excluding share-based compensation effects of approximately
        $600 million).

    --  Capital spending: $6.6 billion plus or minus $200 million.

    --  Tax rate: Approximately 30.5 percent for the third and fourth
        quarters.

    --  Depreciation: $4.7 billion plus or minus $100 million,
        unchanged.

    --  Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs:
        Approximately $45 million.

    The above statements and any others in this document that refer to
plans and expectations for the second quarter, the year and the future
involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause
Intel's actual results to differ materially from current expectations,
including the following:

    --  Intel operates in intensely competitive industries that are
        characterized by a high percentage of costs that are fixed or
        difficult to reduce in the short term, and by product demand
        that is highly variable and difficult to forecast. Revenue and
        the gross margin percentage are affected by the timing of new
        Intel product introductions and the demand for and market
        acceptance of Intel's products; actions taken by Intel's
        competitors, including product offerings, marketing programs
        and pricing pressures; Intel's ability to respond quickly to
        technological developments and to incorporate new features
        into its products; and the availability of sufficient
        inventory of Intel products and related components from other
        suppliers to meet demand. Factors that could cause demand to
        be different from Intel's expectations include customer
        acceptance of Intel and competitors' products; changes in
        customer order patterns, including order cancellations;
        changes in the level of inventory at customers; and changes in
        business and economic conditions.

    --  The gross margin percentage could vary from expectations based
        on changes in revenue levels; product mix and pricing;
        variations in inventory valuation, including variations
        related to the timing of qualifying products for sale; excess
        or obsolete inventory; manufacturing yields; changes in unit
        costs; capacity utilization; impairments of long-lived assets,
        including manufacturing, assembly/test and intangible assets;
        and the timing and execution of the manufacturing ramp and
        associated costs, including start-up costs.

    --  Expenses, particularly certain marketing and compensation
        expenses, vary depending on the level of demand for Intel's
        products and the level of revenue and profits.

    --  The tax rate expectation is based on current tax law and
        current expected income and assumes Intel continues to receive
        tax benefits for export sales. The tax rate may be affected by
        the closing of acquisitions or divestitures; the jurisdictions
        in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;
        changes in the estimates of credits, benefits and deductions;
        the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various
        tax authorities; and the ability to realize deferred tax
        assets.

    --  Gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other
        could vary from expectations depending on equity market levels
        and volatility; gains or losses realized on the sale or
        exchange of securities; impairment charges related to
        marketable, non-marketable and other investments; interest
        rates; cash balances; and changes in fair value of derivative
        instruments.

    --  Dividend declarations and the dividend rate are at the
        discretion of Intel's board of directors, and plans for future
        dividends may be revised by the board. Intel's dividend and
        stock buyback programs could be affected by changes in its
        capital spending programs, changes in its cash flows and
        changes in the tax laws, as well as by the level and timing of
        acquisition and investment activity.

    --  Intel's results could be impacted by unexpected economic,
        social and political conditions in the countries in which
        Intel, its customers or its suppliers operate, including
        security risks, possible infrastructure disruptions, health
        concerns, natural disasters and fluctuations in foreign
        currency exchange rates.

    --  Intel's results could be affected by adverse effects
        associated with product defects and errata (deviations from
        published specifications), and by litigation or regulatory
        matters involving intellectual property, stockholder,
        consumer, antitrust and other issues, such as the litigation
        and regulatory matters described in Intel's SEC reports.

    --  Intel's results could be affected by the amount, type, and
        valuation of share-based awards granted as well as the amount
        of awards cancelled due to employee turnover and the timing of
        award exercises by employees.

    A more detailed discussion of these and other factors that could
affect results is included in Intel's SEC filings, including the
report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2005.

    Status of Business Outlook

    During the quarter, Intel's corporate representatives may
reiterate the Business Outlook during private meetings with investors,
investment analysts, the media and others. From the close of business
on June 2 until publication of the company's second-quarter 2006
earnings release on July 19, Intel will observe a "Quiet Period"
during which the Business Outlook disclosed in the company's press
releases and filings with the SEC on Form 10-K should be considered to
be historical, speaking as of prior to the Quiet Period only and not
subject to update by the company.

    Earnings Webcast

    Intel will hold a public webcast at 2:30 p.m. PDT today on its
Investor Relations Web site at www.intc.com, with a replay available

    In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),
the company's earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures
that exclude the effects of share-based compensation and the
requirements of SFAS No. 123R, "Share-based Payment" ("123R"). The
non-GAAP financial measures used by management and disclosed by the
company exclude the income statement effects of all forms of
share-based compensation and the effects of 123R upon the number of
diluted shares used in calculating non-GAAP earnings per share. The
non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the company should not be
considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures
calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results
calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those
financial statements should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP
financial measures used by the company may be calculated differently
from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled
measures used by other companies. Set forth below are reconciliations
of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable
GAAP financial measures. For additional information regarding these
non-GAAP financial measures, see the Form 8-K dated April 19, 2006
that Intel has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
