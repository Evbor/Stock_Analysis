          Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein
          is financial information for Intel Corporation for the quarter ended
          March 31, 2007 and forward-looking statements relating to 2007 and the
          second quarter of 2007 as presented in a press release of April 17,
          2007.

          Also included in Exhibit 99.1 under the heading "Supplemental
          Operating Results and Other Information" is certain unaudited
          annual and quarterly financial information for the Digital Enterprise
          Group, Mobility Group, Flash Memory Group, and "all other" category.
          In the first quarter of 2007, the company began allocating share-based
          compensation to the operating segments, and results have been adjusted
          retrospectively to reflect this change as well as certain other minor
          reorganizations. The allocation of share-based compensation to the
          operating segments does not in any way restate or revise the
          consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows
          of Intel Corporation as set forth in any previously reported
          consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of income or
          consolidated statement of cash flows of the company. This information
          is provided as supplemental financial information that may be of
          interest to Intel Corporation stockholders.

          The information in this report shall be deemed incorporated by
          reference into any registration statement heretofore or hereafter
          filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except to the
          extent that such information is superseded by information as of a
          subsequent date that is included in or incorporated by reference into
          such registration statement. The information in this report shall not
          be treated as filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of
          1934, as amended.


Item 7.01 REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE

          In connection with the company's ongoing program designed to improve
          operational efficiency and results, the company previously announced
          that it had determined on August 30, 2006 to undertake a number of
          additional actions recommended by the company's Structure and
          Efficiency Taskforce relating to organizational efficiency, business
          processes and programs (collectively, the "Efficiency Plan"). The
          company recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of $75
          million in the first quarter of 2007.

          Previously, Intel Corporation approved a plan to place for sale its
          fabrication facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The assets subject
          to this impairment were principally used in support of the
          communications and application processor business.

          During the fourth quarter of 2006, the company recorded non-cash land,
          building and equipment write-downs of approximately $214 million. As a
          result of softer than anticipated market conditions, in the first
          quarter of 2007, the company recorded additional non-cash write-downs
          of approximately $54 million.

          The company currently expects to incur additional charges related to
          employee severance and benefit arrangements of approximately $60
          million in the second quarter of 2007, which includes the impacts of
          our ongoing Efficiency Plan and expected severance charges related to
          the Colorado Springs facility. For the employees at the Colorado
          Springs facility, plans regarding employee termination benefits will
          depend in part on the terms of any sales transaction regarding the
          facility.

          The exact timing of charges from employee severance and benefit
          arrangements and the related cash outflows, as well as the estimated
          cost ranges by category type, has not been finalized. This information
          will be subject to the finalization of timetables for the transition
          of functions, local labor law requirements, including consultation
          with appropriate works councils as well as the statutory severance
          requirements of the particular legal jurisdictions impacted, and the
          amount and timing of the actual charges may vary due to a variety of
          factors including the salary, position and number of years of service
          of the affected employees as well as the type and amount of severance
          benefits offered to employees.

                                       2
<PAGE>


          Additional, presently undetermined, charges related to the Efficiency
          Plan may be incurred in the remainder of 2007 and 2008 and 2009 fiscal
          years. Additional details will be provided in the company's earnings
          releases and Business Outlook statements published quarterly in such
          fiscal years. The Efficiency Plan reflects the Corporation's intention
          only.

          This Form 8-K and attached press release contain forward-looking
          statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. In
          addition to the factors addressed in the attached press release
          relating to forward looking statements made in the press release, many
          factors could affect the planned sale of the Colorado Springs
          facility, the Efficiency Plan and the company's actual results, and if
          the risks or uncertainties ever materialize or the assumptions prove
          incorrect, the results of the company may differ materially from those
          expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements and
          assumptions. All statements other than statements of historical fact
          are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements,
          including but not limited to any to any projections of charges or
          other financial items; any statements of the plans, strategies and
          objectives of management for future operations, including the timing
          and execution of the planned sale of the Colorado Springs facility or
          any restructuring plan; benefit program changes and the extent of
          employees impacted by planned sale of the Colorado Springs facility or
          the restructuring; and any statements or assumptions underlying any of
          the foregoing; the extent or timing of cost savings, use of cost
          savings, revenue or profitability improvements, or other financial
          items; any statements concerning the company's expected competitive
          position or performance; any statements of expectation or belief; and
          any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Intel
          presently considers the factors set forth below to be the important
          factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the
          company's published expectations: risks, uncertainties and assumptions
          including the timing and execution of plans and programs subject to
          local labor law requirements, including consultation with appropriate
          works councils; assumptions related to severance and post-retirement
          costs; future acquisitions, dispositions, investments, new business
          initiatives and changes in product roadmap, development and
          manufacturing which may affect expense and employment levels at the
          company; assumptions relating to product demand and the business
          environment; and other risk factors that are described from time to
          time in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission reports,
          including but not limited to the risk factors described in the
          company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30,
          2006. The company assumes no obligation to update these
          forward-looking statements.

                    Intel First-Quarter Revenue $8.9 Billion

                   Operating Income $1.7 Billion, EPS 27 Cents

     SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 17, 2007--Intel Corporation
today announced first-quarter revenue of $8.9 billion, operating income of $1.7
billion, net income of $1.6 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of 27 cents.
The results included the effect of a $300-million reversal of previously accrued
taxes that increased EPS by approximately 5 cents.

     "The strong momentum of our industry-leading Intel(R) Core(TM)
microarchitecture product family, combined with ongoing structural cost
improvements, delivered solid financial results in the first quarter," said
Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini. "Our product strength is reflected in the
fact that average selling prices for the quarter held up well in a very
competitive environment."

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------


     Financial and Key Product Trends

     --   First-quarter gross margin was 50.1 percent, higher than 49.6 percent
          in the previous quarter as lower microprocessor unit costs and the
          sale of previously reserved inventory more than offset the effects of
          higher 45 nanometer (nm) start-up costs and lower revenue.

     --   The company reached its goal of reducing the workforce to
          approximately 92,000 people, meeting the target one quarter ahead of
          schedule.

     --   Total microprocessor units were lower sequentially. The ASP was
          slightly lower driven by a lower mix within server processors, with
          desktop and mobile ASPs approximately flat.

     --   Chipset, motherboard and flash memory units were lower sequentially.

     Business Outlook

     The following expectations do not include the potential impact of any
mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other business combinations that may be
completed after April 16.

     Q2 2007 Outlook

     --   Revenue: Expected to be between $8.2 billion and $8.8 billion.

     --   Gross margin: 48 percent plus or minus a couple of points.

     --   Spending (R&D plus MG&A): Between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. In
          addition, the company expects a second-quarter restructuring charge of
          approximately $60 million.

     --   Net gains from equity investments and interest and other:
          Approximately $150 million.

     --   Tax rate: Approximately 31 percent.

     --   Depreciation: Between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion.

     2007 Outlook

     --   Gross margin: 51 percent plus or minus a few points, higher than the
          previous expectation of 50 percent plus or minus a few points.

     --   R&D: Approximately $5.6 billion, higher than the previous expectation
          of approximately $5.4 billion.

     --   MG&A: Approximately $5.1 billion, lower than the previous expectation
          of approximately $5.3 billion.

     --   Capital spending: $5.5 billion plus or minus $200 million, unchanged.

     --   Tax rate: Approximately 31 percent in the third and fourth quarters.
          The previous expectation was approximately 30 percent for the year.

     --   Depreciation: $4.8 billion plus or minus $100 million, unchanged.

     The above statements and any others in this document that refer to plans
and expectations for the second quarter, the year and the future are
forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.
Many factors could affect Intel's actual results, and variances from Intel's
current expectations regarding such factors could cause actual results to differ
materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Intel
presently considers the factors set forth below in the section entitled "Risk
Factors" to be the important factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from the Corporation's published expectations.

     Recent Events

     --   Intel announced that its upcoming 45nm transistor technology is based
          on breakthrough Hi-K metal gate transistor materials that increase
          performance and reduce leakage, enabling faster and more
          energy-efficient microprocessors. The company announced that fifteen
          45nm microprocessors are in development and demonstrated
          pre-production desktop, mobile and server platforms running five
          operating systems, with shipments scheduled to begin in the second
          half of 2007.

     --   Intel announced that Fab 11X in Rio Rancho, New Mexico will be
          re-tooled to become the company's fourth 300mm factory capable of
          producing 45nm microprocessors. Intel also announced plans to build a
          300mm factory in China, with production to begin in 2010.

     --   Intel expanded its quad-core microprocessor line-up to include its
          first 50-watt quad-core server processors, first quad-core processors
          for embedded designs, and fastest-ever quad-core processors for
          extreme gaming and digital design. The company has now introduced 12
          quad-core processors for use in computing, storage and embedded
          applications.

     --   Intel and Sun Microsystems announced a broad strategic alliance that
          will result in Sun delivering a comprehensive family of enterprise and
          telecommunications servers and workstations based on Intel(R) Xeon(R)
          processors, with Intel supporting Solaris(1) as a mainstream operating
          system.

     --   The company's Intel(R) vPro(TM) processor technology, which brings
          manageability and security benefits to IT managers, has been deployed
          by more than 200 companies and institutions including 3M, BMW,
          FujiFilm, ING, Johns Hopkins, Pioneer and Verizon.

     --   The company introduced the Intel(R) Centrino(R) Pro processor
          technology brand, with plans to bring more of the security and
          manageability capabilities of Intel's business desktop platforms to
          notebook PCs.

     --   The company introduced Wi-Fi connections based on the new 802.11n
          specification that will give future users of Intel(R) Centrino(R)
          processor technology up to five times the Wi-Fi performance and twice
          the range of earlier technologies.

     --   The company announced shipments of Intel-powered "classmate PCs,"
          bringing affordable mobile computing to K-12 students in Brazil and
          Mexico, with plans for pilot programs in 25 countries.

     --   Intel announced "solid-state drive" products that use Intel NAND flash
          chips as an alternative to rotating magnetic disk drive technology.

     --   Intel researchers developed an 80-core "tera-scale" processor that
          brings supercomputer-like performance to a single chip. The
          experimental processor may lead to future Intel products bringing
          trillions of calculations per second to PCs and servers.

     Risk Factors

     --   Intel operates in intensely competitive industries that are
          characterized by a high percentage of costs that are fixed or
          difficult to reduce in the short term, significant pricing pressures,
          and product demand that is highly variable and difficult to forecast.
          Revenue and the gross margin percentage are affected by the timing of
          new Intel product introductions and the demand for and market
          acceptance of Intel's products; actions taken by Intel's competitors,
          including product offerings, marketing programs and pricing pressures
          and Intel's response to such actions; Intel's ability to respond
          quickly to technological developments and to incorporate new features
          into its products; and the availability of sufficient components from
          suppliers to meet demand. Factors that could cause demand to be
          different from Intel's expectations include customer acceptance of
          Intel and competitors' products; changes in customer order patterns,
          including order cancellations; changes in the level of inventory at
          customers; and changes in business and economic conditions.

     --   The gross margin percentage could vary significantly from expectations
          based on changes in revenue levels; product mix and pricing; capacity
          utilization; variations in inventory valuation; excess or obsolete
          inventory; manufacturing yields; changes in unit costs; impairments of
          long-lived assets, including manufacturing, assembly/test and
          intangible assets; and the timing and execution of the manufacturing
          ramp and associated costs, including start-up costs.

     --   Expenses, particularly certain marketing and compensation expenses,
          vary depending on the level of demand for Intel's products, the level
          of revenue and profits and impairments of long-lived assets.

     --   Intel is in the midst of a structure and efficiency program that is
          resulting in several actions that could have an impact on expected
          expense levels and gross margin.

     --   The tax rate expectation is based on current tax law and current
          expected income. The tax rate may be affected by the closing of
          acquisitions or divestitures; the jurisdictions in which profits are
          determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the estimates of
          credits, benefits and deductions; the resolution of issues arising
          from tax audits with various tax authorities, including payment of
          interest and penalties; and the ability to realize deferred tax
          assets.

     --   Gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other could
          vary from expectations depending on equity market levels and
          volatility; gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of
          securities; gains or losses from equity method investments; impairment
          charges related to marketable, non-marketable and other investments;
          interest rates; cash balances; and changes in fair value of derivative
          instruments.

     --   Intel's results could be affected by the amount, type, and valuation
          of share-based awards granted as well as the amount of awards
          cancelled due to employee turnover and the timing of award exercises
          by employees.

     --   Intel's results could be impacted by unexpected economic, social,
          political and physical/infrastructure conditions in the countries in
          which Intel, its customers or its suppliers operate, including
          military conflict and other security risks, natural disasters,
          infrastructure disruptions, health concerns and fluctuations in
          currency exchange rates.

     --   Intel's results could be affected by adverse effects associated with
          product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications),
          and by litigation or regulatory matters involving intellectual
          property, stockholder, consumer, antitrust and other issues, such as
          the litigation and regulatory matters described in Intel's SEC
          reports.

     A detailed discussion of these and other factors that could affect Intel's
results is included in Intel's SEC filings, including the report on Form 10-K
for the year ended Dec. 30, 2006.

     Status of Business Outlook

     During the quarter, Intel's corporate representatives may reiterate the
Business Outlook during private meetings with investors, investment analysts,
the media and others. From the close of business on June 1 until publication of
the company's second-quarter 2007 earnings release, Intel will observe a "Quiet
Period" during which the Business Outlook disclosed in the company's press
releases and filings with the SEC should be considered to be historical,
speaking as of prior to the Quiet Period only and not subject to update by the
company.

The company's operating segments include the Digital Enterprise Group,
 Mobility Group, Flash Memory Group, Digital Home Group, and Digital
 Health Group. Beginning in the first quarter of 2007, the Channel
 Platforms Group will directly support Intel's operating segments.
 Prior-period amounts have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect
 certain reorganizations.

The company has sales and marketing, manufacturing, finance, and
 administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally
 allocated to the operating segments and the expenses are included in
 the operating results reported above. Additionally, in the first
 quarter of 2007, the company began allocating share-based
 compensation to the operating segments and adjusted results
 retrospectively to reflect this change. Revenue for the "all other"
 category primarily relates to microprocessors and related chipsets
 sold by the Digital Home Group. In addition to the operating results
 for the Digital Home Group and Digital Health Group operating
 segments, the "all other" category includes certain corporate-level
 operating expenses. These expenses include:
  -- a portion of profit-dependent bonus and other expenses not
   allocated to the operating segments;
  -- results of operations of seed businesses that support the
   company's initiatives;
  -- acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any
   impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill;
  -- charges for purchased in-process research and development; and
  -- amounts included within restructuring and asset impairment
   charges in the consolidated condensed statements of income.
