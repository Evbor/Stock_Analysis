              Intel First-Quarter Revenue $9.4 Billion;
                     Earnings Per Share 34 Cents

    SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 19, 2005--Intel
Corporation today announced first-quarter revenue of $9.4 billion, up
17 percent year-over-year and down 2 percent sequentially.
    First-quarter net income was $2.2 billion, up 25 percent
year-over-year and up 1 percent sequentially. Earnings per share were
34 cents, up 31 percent from 26 cents in the first quarter of 2004 and
up 3 percent from 33 cents in the fourth quarter of 2004. Intel's
first quarter included an additional week of business because 2005 is
a 53-week fiscal year for the company. Last year's first-quarter
results included a legal settlement charge that reduced earnings per
share by 1.7 cents.
    "Led by strong demand for our mobile products, Intel posted
double-digit revenue and profit growth versus a year ago," said Intel
CEO Craig Barrett. "Today marks the 40th anniversary of Moore's Law,
which remains the driving force behind our ability to continually
innovate and bring exciting new products to our customers around the
world. In the coming quarters we expect to carry on the pace set over
past decades by ramping our industry-leading 65nm process technology
and launching additional dual-core microprocessors for our desktop,
notebook and server platforms."
    During the quarter, Intel announced a broad reorganization
bringing all major product groups in line with the company's strategy
to develop and deliver complete technology platforms based on Intel
ingredients. Intel's goal is to change its operating segment
presentation to reflect the company's new organizational structure
beginning with its Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2005. The
Digital Enterprise Group and Mobility Group will be reportable
segments under the new structure, while the Digital Home Group,
Digital Health Group and Channel Platforms Group are expected to be
included in the "all other" category.

    BUSINESS OUTLOOK

    The following statements are based on current expectations. These
statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ
materially. Please see the Risk Factors Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements in this release for a description of certain important risk
factors that could cause actual results to differ, and refer to
Intel's annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) for a more complete description of the
risks. These statements do not include the potential impact of any
mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other business combinations
that may be completed after April 18, 2005.

    --  Revenue in the second quarter is expected to be between $8.6
        billion and $9.2 billion.

    --  Gross margin percentage for the second quarter is expected to
        be approximately 56 percent, plus or minus a couple of points,
        as compared to 59.3 percent in the first quarter. The gross
        margin percentage expectation for 2005 is now 59 percent, plus
        or minus a few points, as compared to the previous expectation
        of 58 percent, plus or minus a few points. The gross margin
        percentage could vary from expectations based on changes in
        revenue levels, product mix and pricing, manufacturing yields,
        changes in unit costs, variations in inventory valuation,
        excess or obsolete inventory, capacity utilization and the
        existence of excess capacity, impairments of long-lived
        assets, including manufacturing, assembly/test and intangible
        assets, and the timing and execution of the manufacturing ramp
        and associated costs, including start-up costs.

    --  Expenses (R&D plus MG&A) in the second quarter are expected to
        be approximately $2.6 billion. Expenses, particularly certain
        marketing and compensation expenses, could vary from
        expectations depending on the level of demand for Intel's
        products and the level of revenue and profits.

    --  The R&D spending expectation for 2005 is unchanged at
        approximately $5.2 billion.

    --  Capital spending for 2005 is now expected to be between $5.4
        billion and $5.8 billion, higher than the previous expectation
        of between $4.9 billion and $5.3 billion, driven primarily by
        stronger than anticipated business and increased confidence in
        the company's 65nm process technology ramp.

    --  Gains from equity investments and interest and other in the
        second quarter are expected to be approximately $70 million.

    --  The tax rate for the second, third and fourth quarters is
        currently expected to be approximately 31 percent. This
        expectation does not reflect the impact of any potential
        repatriation of cash under the American Jobs Creation Act. The
        tax rate expectation is based on current tax law and current
        expected income and assumes Intel continues to receive tax
        benefits for export sales. The tax rate may be affected by the
        closing of acquisitions or divestitures, the jurisdiction in
        which profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes
        in the estimates of credits, benefits and deductions, the
        resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax
        authorities and the ability to realize deferred tax assets.

    --  Depreciation for the second quarter is expected to be $1.1
        billion, plus or minus $100 million. The depreciation
        expectation for the full year is unchanged at $4.4 billion,
        plus or minus $100 million.

    --  Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs is
        expected to be approximately $35 million in the second quarter
        and approximately $125 million for the full year.

    FIRST-QUARTER REVIEW AND RECENT HIGHLIGHTS

    Financial Review

    --  The gross margin percentage was 59.3 percent, higher than the
        revised expectation of 57 percent, plus or minus a point,
        primarily due to better than anticipated microprocessor mix
        and costs along with earlier than anticipated shipment
        qualification of certain new products.

    --  Intel used $2.5 billion in cash to repurchase 107.9 million
        shares of its common stock during the quarter under an ongoing
        program.

    --  The company paid a cash dividend of 8 cents per share on March
        1 to stockholders of record on February 7. The company's board
        of directors last year approved a doubling of the company's
        quarterly cash dividend to 8 cents per share.

    Key Product Trends (Sequential)

    --  Total microprocessor units and the average selling price were
        approximately flat. Mobile microprocessor units set a record.

    --  Chipset units were lower.

    --  Motherboard units were lower.

    --  Flash memory units were lower.

    --  Wireless connectivity units set a record.

    --  Wired connectivity units were lower.

    RISK FACTORS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

    The statements in this document that refer to plans and
expectations for the second quarter, the year and the future are
forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and
uncertainties. Many factors could affect Intel's actual results, and
variances from Intel's current expectations regarding such factors
could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed
in these forward-looking statements. Intel presently considers the
factors accompanying certain of such statements above and set forth
below to be the important factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from Intel's published expectations. A more detailed
discussion of these factors, as well as other factors that could
affect Intel's results, is contained in Intel's SEC filings, including
the report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 25, 2004.

    --  Intel operates in intensely competitive industries. Revenue
        and the gross margin percentage are affected by the demand for
        and market acceptance of Intel's products, the availability of
        sufficient inventory to meet demand, pricing pressures and
        actions taken by Intel's competitors, and the timing of new
        product introductions. Factors that could cause demand to be
        different from Intel's expectations include changes in
        customer order patterns, including order cancellations,
        changes in the level of inventory at customers, and changes in
        business and economic conditions.

    --  Gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other
        could vary from expectations depending on equity market levels
        and volatility, gains or losses realized on the sale or
        exchange of securities, impairment charges related to
        marketable, non-marketable and other investments, interest
        rates, cash balances and changes in fair value of derivative
        instruments.

    --  Intel's results could be impacted by unexpected economic,
        social and political conditions in the countries in which
        Intel, its customers or its suppliers operate, including
        security risks, possible infrastructure disruptions and
        fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

    --  Intel's results could also be affected by adverse effects
        associated with product defects and errata (deviations from
        published specifications), and by litigation or regulatory
        matters involving intellectual property, stockholder,
        consumer, antitrust and other issues, such as the litigation
        and regulatory matters described in Intel's SEC reports.

    Intel, the world's largest chip maker, is also a leading
manufacturer of computer, networking and communications products.
