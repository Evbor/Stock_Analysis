Intel News Release

Intel Elects Yahoo! Executive Susan Decker to Board of
Directors
John Browne to Retire

SANTA CLARA, Calif., Nov. 16, 2006 - Intel Corporation today
announced that Susan Decker, chief financial officer and
executive vice president, finance and administration at
Yahoo!, has been elected to serve on Intel's board of
directors. The company also announced that John Browne, an
Intel director since 1997, is retiring from the board.

"We're extremely pleased to have Susan Decker join the Intel
board," said Craig Barrett, Intel chairman. "Susan's
extensive business background, leadership and understanding
of the technology industry will be valuable assets to Intel.

"At the same time, we want to thank John Browne for his
years of service on the Intel board. John has been an
important contributor to the board for nearly 10 years. His
unique insights and perspectives as one of the most
successful international business leaders in the world were
always highly valued. At a time when Intel was rapidly
expanding its international operations John's counsel was
especially important. We wish him well in the future."

Decker is a key participant in determining Yahoo!'s business
strategy, has operational responsibilities for Yahoo!'s
Marketplaces business unit, and is also responsible for
managing and setting all aspects of the company's financial
and administrative direction within key functional areas
including finance, human resources, legal and investor
relations. Prior to joining Yahoo! in 2000, Decker held a
number of positions with Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette
during her 14-year career with the investment banking firm.

Decker received her bachelor's degree from Tufts University
with a double major in computer science and economics. She
received a master's degree in business administration from
Harvard Business School.

technologies, products and initiatives to continually
