Item 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     Attached  hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and  incorporated  by reference  herein is
     financial information for Intel Corporation for the quarter and fiscal year
     ended December 30, 2006 and forward-looking  statements relating to 2007 as
     presented in a press release of January 16, 2007.  The  information in this
     report  shall be deemed  incorporated  by reference  into any  registration
     statement  heretofore or hereafter  filed under the Securities Act of 1933,
     as amended,  except to the extent that such  information  is  superseded by
     information as of a subsequent  date that is included in or incorporated by
     reference into such registration statement.  The information in this report
     shall not be treated as filed for purposes of the  Securities  Exchange Act
     of 1934, as amended.

     In addition to disclosing  financial results  calculated in accordance with
     United States (U.S.) generally accepted  accounting  principles (GAAP), the
     company's  earnings  release  contains  non-GAAP  financial  measures  that
     exclude the effects of share-based  compensation  and the  requirements  of
     Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  123  (revised  2004),
     "Share-Based  Payment" (SFAS No. 123(R)).  The non-GAAP  financial measures
     used  by  management  and  disclosed  by the  company  exclude  the  income
     statement effects of all forms of share-based  compensation and the effects
     of SFAS No.  123(R)  upon the  number  of  diluted  common  shares  used in
     calculating  non-GAAP diluted  earnings per share.  The non-GAAP  financial
     measures  disclosed  by the company  should not be  considered a substitute
     for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP,
     and  the  financial   results   calculated  in  accordance  with  GAAP  and
     reconciliations   to  those  financial   statements   should  be  carefully
     evaluated.  The  non-GAAP  financial  measures  used by the  company may be
     calculated  differently  from,  and  therefore  may not be  comparable  to,
     similarly titled measures used by other companies. The company has provided
     reconciliations  of the non-GAAP  financial  measures to the most  directly
     comparable  GAAP  financial  measures.  The company  applied  the  modified
     prospective method of adoption of SFAS No. 123(R),  under which the effects
     of SFAS No. 123(R) are reflected in the company's GAAP financial  statement
     presentations  for and after the first quarter 2006,  but are not reflected
     in results for prior periods.

     In managing the company's business on a consolidated basis, consistent with
     how we managed  the  business  prior to the  adoption  of SFAS No.  123(R),
     management developed the 2006 annual budget including all components of the
     income  statement,  exclusive of  share-based  compensation.  Gross margin,
     expenses   (research   and   development   and   marketing,   general   and
     administrative),  operating  income,  income taxes,  net income and diluted
     earnings per share (EPS) are the primary  consolidated  financial  measures
     management  uses for  planning  and  forecasting  future  periods  that are
     affected  by  share-based  compensation.  The  company's  2006  budget  and
     planning process  commenced with a segment-level  evaluation which excluded
     share-based  compensation,   and  culminated  with  the  preparation  of  a
     consolidated  annual and/or  quarterly  budget that included these non-GAAP
     financial measures. This budget, once finalized and approved, served as the
     basis for the  allocation of resources and  management of  operations.  The
     number of full-time equivalent employees working in manufacturing, research
     and development,  and marketing,  general and administrative  related roles
     was  determined  through the  budgeting  process  exclusive of  share-based
     compensation,  and our tax  strategies  were  determined on a  consolidated
     basis  exclusive  of the  expenses  and  related  tax  benefit  relating to
     share-based  compensation.  The  accounting  expense  impact of share-based
     compensation   was  not  discussed  nor   considered   when  assessing  and
     determining  gross margin or the appropriate level of budgeted expenses for
     research  and  development,   and  marketing,  general  and  administrative
     expenses.  Accordingly,  such  amounts  were  excluded  from  the  budgeted
     operating income, net income, and earnings per share.  GAAP-basis financial
     statements which include the effects of share-based  compensation were only
     reviewed  and  analyzed in 2006 for  purposes of external  reporting  where
     GAAP-basis financial statements are necessary.

     Under our 2006 budget and planning  process,  consistent  with our practice
     prior to the adoption of SFAS No.  123(R),  management did not consider the
     effects of share-based  compensation when seeking to reduce unit costs with
     the goal of increasing  gross margin.  When assessing the level of research
     and development efforts, consistent with our practice prior to the adoption
     of SFAS No. 123(R),  management did not consider the effects of share-based
     compensation. When making decisions about project spending,  administrative
     budgets, or marketing programs,  management did not consider the effects of
     share-based compensation.

                                       2
<PAGE>

     In  addition  to  using  the  budget  process  for  planning  and  resource
     allocation, on a quarterly basis we analyze the performance of our business
     in 2006 on a  consolidated  basis by comparing our gross  margin,  expenses
     (research  and  development  and  marketing,  general and  administrative),
     operating  income,  net  income,  and  diluted  earnings  per  share,  each
     excluding  share-based  compensation,  to the prior  period and  forecasted
     amounts  developed during the budget and planning  process,  also excluding
     share-based  compensation.  We use these quarterly  assessments to evaluate
     the  performance  of the business  against  prior periods and budget and to
     develop our 2006 business outlook which we communicated to investors.

     Consistent with our practice prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R),  the
     company's  share-based  compensation plans are established and managed on a
     company-wide  basis,  including  specification  of grant  types and  amount
     ranges for  employees by category  and grade.  Our  philosophy  relative to
     share-based  compensation  programs is built on the  principle  that equity
     compensation  should seek to align  employees'  actions and behaviors  with
     stockholders' interest; be market competitive; be able to attract, motivate
     and retain the best employees;  and support Intel's belief in a broad-based
     approach.  Share based compensation granted to employees is in addition to,
     not  in  lieu  of,  cash   compensation.   Accordingly,   our   share-based
     compensation  programs are evaluated  separately from the cost of our other
     compensation programs.  Specifically, our share-based compensation programs
     are carefully  evaluated from the perspective of the resulting dilution and
     other  metrics,  and not from the  resulting  expense to be  recorded.  For
     example,  our  goal has been to keep  the  potential  incremental  dilution
     related to our equity  incentive plans (stock options and restricted  stock
     units) to a  long-term  average  of less  than 2%  annually.  The  dilution
     percentage  is  calculated  using  the  new  equity-based  awards,  net  of
     equity-based  awards  cancelled  due to  employees  leaving the company and
     expired  stock  options,  divided  by the total  outstanding  shares at the
     beginning of the year. Further,  as noted above,  segment managers were not
     held  accountable for share-based  compensation  charges in 2006, and these
     charges did not impact  their  business  unit's  operating  income  (loss).
     Accordingly,  share-based  compensation charges have been excluded from the
     company's  measure of  segment  profitability  (operating  income) in 2006.
     Therefore,  when evaluating  segment operating  income,  management and the
     Board of Directors excluded share-based compensation.

     Currently,  operating income and net income, both on a per-share basis, are
     calculated  excluding  share-based  compensation for purposes of evaluating
     profit-dependent cash incentive  compensation paid to employees,  including
     senior management.  For example, for 2006, the executive  compensation cash
     incentive plan formula measures EPS as the greater of (a) Intel's operating
     income or (b)  Intel's  net income (in both cases  excluding  the effect of
     share-based  compensation),  divided by Intel's  weighted  average  diluted
     common   shares   outstanding,   excluding   the  effects  of   share-based
     compensation.   The  calculation  of  diluted  common  shares  outstanding,
     excluding the effects of  share-based  compensation,  excludes the proceeds
     from the remaining unamortized  share-based  compensation,  and adjusts the
     proceeds  from  tax  benefits  by  excluding  the  effects  of  share-based
     compensation.   The  calculation  of  diluted  common  shares  outstanding,
     excluding  the  effects  of  share-based  compensation  is  similar  to the
     calculation of diluted common shares outstanding, as reported, prior to the
     adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). Accordingly,  when budgeting for the company's
     2006  profit-dependent  cash  incentives,  the company  applied the formula
     above to calculate earnings per share excluding share-based compensation so
     as to be able to factor the  appropriate  amount of profit  dependent  cash
     incentive into the budget.

     The company  discloses  this non-GAAP  information  to the public to enable
     investors to more easily assess the company's performance on the same basis
     applied by  management  and to ease  comparison on both a GAAP and non-GAAP
     basis to our prior period results.  In particular the company believes that
     it is  useful  to  investors  to  understand  how the  expenses  and  other
     adjustments  associated  with the  application of SFAS No. 123(R) are being
     reflected on the company's  income  statements.  Management  believes gross
     margin,  excluding  share-based  compensation,  research  and  development,
     excluding   share-based   compensation,   and   marketing,   general,   and
     administrative  expense,  excluding  share-based  compensation,  are useful
     information  for  investors  because the 2006 GAAP measure when compared in
     isolation  with 2005 would  indicate a level of increase in those  expenses
     inconsistent with actual performance. We believe that the non-GAAP measures
     serve to provide a baseline for investors in this first year of adoption to
     compare  actual  results  for  the  current  year,  excluding   share-based
     compensation  to the prior  year GAAP  amounts  which  exclude  share-based
     compensation.

     Management  believes  providing  2006  operating  income  and  net  income,
     excluding  share-based  compensation,  is useful  information  to investors
     because it assists investors in evaluating  operating income and net income
     consistent with how management evaluated  performance and to understand the
     basis for the company's profit dependent cash incentive plan. Especially in
     this first year of applying the provisions of SFAS No.  123(R),  we believe

                                       3
<PAGE>

     operating  and net  income as  reported  in our  income  statement  are not
     comparable to prior year period amounts,  and may lead investors to believe
     business has  declined  more  significantly  than would be caused by actual
     changes in the  business  (as  opposed to changes in  accounting  treatment
     between  years).   When  presenting  net  income,   excluding   share-based
     compensation,  we believe it appropriate to exclude the related tax benefit
     recognized  in the  financial  statements  for purposes of  presenting  net
     income  or  EPS,  excluding  share-based  compensation.  Providing  diluted
     earnings per share, excluding share-based compensation assists investors in
     evaluating diluted earnings per share compared to prior periods. Especially
     in this  first year of  applying  the  provisions  of SFAS No.  123(R),  we
     believe diluted  earnings per share as reported in our income  statement is
     not comparable to prior year amounts.

     The  basis  for the  company's  decision  to use  these  non-GAAP  measures
     excluding  share-based  compensation  is that  management has determined in
     this first year of adoption of SFAS No.  123(R) to continue to evaluate the
     business  on the same  basis as prior to the  adoption  of SFAS No.  123(R)
     until  there is greater  familiarity  with its effects and until the second
     year after  adoption  of SFAS No.  123(R)  when  financial  information  is
     prepared  and  presented  on  a  consistent  basis  with  the  prior  year.
     Share-based  compensation represents: 1 point of gross margin, $119 million
     of research and development  expenses,  $121 million of marketing,  general
     and  administrative  expenses,  $334 million  reduction in total  operating
     income,  $236 million reduction in total net income,  and a $0.04 reduction
     in diluted  earnings  per share for the quarter  ended  December  30, 2006,
     compared to zero for all such  measures in the quarter  ended  December 31,
     2005. Share-based compensation represents: 1.2 points of gross margin, $107
     million of research and  development  expenses,  $125 million of marketing,
     general  and  administrative  expenses,  $335  million  reduction  in total
     operating income,  $248 million reduction in total net income,  and a $0.05
     reduction in diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended September 30,
     2006. Share-based compensation represents:  1.0 point of gross margin, $487
     million of research and  development  expenses,  $539 million of marketing,
     general and  administrative  expenses,  $1,375  million  reduction in total
     operating income,  $987 million reduction in total net income,  and a $0.17
     reduction  in diluted  earnings  per share for the year ended  December 30,
     2006, compared to zero for all such measures in the year ended December 31,
     2005.

     Unlike  other  forms  of  compensation,  share-based  compensation  was not
     recognized  prior to January 1, 2006 when we adopted the provisions of SFAS
     No. 123(R).  Additionally,  when management determines the annual merit and
     promotional   budget  for   compensation,   the   effects  of   share-based
     compensation  on the company's  financial  statements  are not  considered.
     Rather  share-based  awards  are  generally  granted  via a  fixed  formula
     depending  on position  and level of the  employee.  In  addition,  segment
     managers were held accountable for other forms of compensation, and as such
     those compensation charges are included in the segments' results and in the
     budget and planning processes of our reporting segments in 2006.

     A material limitation associated with the use of these measures as compared
     to the related  GAAP  measures is that they may reduce  comparability  with
     other companies who may use different types of equity incentive  awards, or
     whose compensation structures may use share-based compensation to a greater

                                       4
<PAGE>

     or lesser extent as part of their overall  compensation.  These differences
     may cause our non-GAAP measures excluding  share-based  compensation to not
     be comparable to other companies'  non-GAAP measures excluding  share-based
     compensation.  Other material limitations  associated with the use of these
     measures as compared to the GAAP comparable measure include:  gross margin,
     excluding share-based  compensation,  does not include all costs related to
     the cost of inventory  sold during the period;  research  and  development,
     excluding share-based  compensation,  does not include all costs related to
     the  research and  development  needed to bring new products to the market;
     marketing,   general  and  administrative  expenses  excluding  share-based
     compensation,  does not include all costs related to the marketing, general
     and  administrative  efforts  required  to manage our  company and sell our
     products.  A material  limitation  with using operating  income,  excluding
     share-based  compensation,  net income, excluding share-based compensation,
     and diluted earnings per share, excluding share-based compensation, is that
     they do not include all costs typically included in the presentation of the
     comparable  GAAP  measure,  and they may not include  all costs  related to
     hiring and retaining qualified employees.

     Although  these  non-GAAP  financial  measures  adjust  cost,  expenses and
     diluted  share items to exclude the  accounting  treatment  of  share-based
     compensation,  they  should  not  be  viewed  as a pro  forma  presentation
     reflecting  the  elimination  of the  underlying  share-based  compensation
     programs. Thus, our non-GAAP presentations are not intended to present, and
     should not be used,  as a basis for assessing  what our  operating  results
     might be if we were to eliminate our share-based compensation programs. Our
     equity   incentive  plans  are  an  important   element  of  the  company's
     compensation  structure and GAAP  indicates  that all forms of  share-based
     payments  should be valued  and  included  as  appropriate  in  results  of
     operations.

     Because of the foregoing limitations, management does not intend to use the
     non-GAAP  financial  measures  when  assessing  the  company's  performance
     against  that of other  companies.  The  company  manages  its  share-based
     compensation  plans in the aggregate  against  certain  metrics rather than
     reviewing  financial  statement  impacts by financial  statement line item.
     Specifically,  our goal has been to keep the potential incremental dilution
     related to our equity  incentive plans (stock options and restricted  stock
     units) to a  long-term  average  of less  than 2%  annually.  The  dilution
     percentage  is  calculated  using  the  new  equity-based  awards,  net  of
     equity-based  awards  cancelled  due to  employees  leaving the company and
     expired  stock  options,  divided  by the total  outstanding  shares at the
     beginning of the year.


Item 7.01 REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE

     In  connection  with the  company's  ongoing  program  designed  to improve
     operational  efficiency and results,  the company previously announced that
     it had  determined  on August 30, 2006 to undertake a number of  additional
     actions  recommended by the company's  Structure and  Efficiency  Taskforce
     relating to  organizational  efficiency,  business  processes  and programs
     (collectively,  the "Efficiency  Plan"). The company's workforce on July 1,
     2006,  before these additional  actions began, was 102,500 persons,  and on
     December 30, 2006, was 94,100 persons.  The company's workforce is expected
     to be further reduced to approximately 92,000 by the middle of 2007.

     The company recorded  restructuring  and asset  impairment  charges of $457
     million in the fourth quarter of 2006 ($555 million for 2006).

     In connection with the divestiture in the fourth quarter of 2006 of certain
     assets  of our  communications  and  application  processor  business,  the
     company  recorded  non-cash  impairment costs of $103 million for tools and
     related installation costs in the fourth quarter.

     Separately,  in response to the divestiture and a subsequent  assessment of
     Intel's worldwide  manufacturing capacity operations,  on January 12, 2007,
     Intel  Corporation  approved  a plan to  place  for  sale  its  fabrication
     facility  in  Colorado  Springs,  Colorado.  The  assets  subject  to  this
     impairment  were  principally  used in  support of the  communications  and
     application processor business.

     Although the company is in the process of completing the valuation of land,
     buildings  and  equipment at the facility,  the company  expects  aggregate
     non-cash land,  building and equipment  write-downs of  approximately  $214
     million, and this estimate was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006.

     The  company  currently  expects  to incur  additional  charges  related to
     employee severance and benefit arrangements of approximately $50 million in
     the first  quarter of 2007,  which  includes  the  impacts  of our  ongoing
     Efficiency Plan and expected  severance  charges related to the sale of the
     Colorado Springs facility.  This facility  currently has approximately 1000
     employees.  For  these  employees,  plans  regarding  employee  termination
     benefits  will  depend  in  part  on the  terms  of any  sales  transaction
     regarding the facility.

     The  exact  timing  of  charges  from   employee   severance   and  benefit
     arrangements  and the related cash outflows,  as well as the estimated cost
     ranges by category type, has not been finalized.  This  information will be
     subject to the  finalization of timetables for the transition of functions,
     local labor law requirements, including consultation with appropriate works
     councils as well as the statutory severance  requirements of the particular
     legal  jurisdictions  impacted,  and the  amount  and  timing of the actual
     charges may vary due to a variety of factors including the salary, position
     and  number of years of service of the  affected  employees  as well as the
     type and amount of severance benefits offered to employees.

     Additional, presently undetermined,  charges related to the Efficiency Plan
     may be incurred in the 2007, 2008 and 2009 fiscal years. Additional details
     will be provided in the company's  earnings  releases and Business  Outlook
     statements  published  quarterly in such fiscal years.  The Efficiency Plan
     reflects the Corporation's intention only.

     This Form 8-K and attached press release contain forward-looking statements
     that  involve  risks,  uncertainties  and  assumptions.  In addition to the
     factors addressed in the attached press release relating to forward looking
     statements made in the press release, many factors could affect the planned
     sale  of the  Colorado  Springs  facility,  the  Efficiency  Plan  and  the
     company's  actual  results,   and  if  the  risks  or  uncertainties   ever
     materialize or the assumptions prove incorrect,  the results of the company
     may   differ   materially   from  those   expressed   or  implied  by  such
     forward-looking  statements  and  assumptions.  All  statements  other than
     statements  of  historical   fact  are  statements  that  could  be  deemed
     forward-looking  statements,  including  but  not  limited  to  any  to any
     projections  of charges or other  financial  items;  any  statements of the
     plans,  strategies  and  objectives  of management  for future  operations,
     including  the timing and  execution  of the planned  sale of the  Colorado
     Springs facility or any restructuring plan; benefit program changes and the
     extent of  employees  impacted  by  planned  sale of the  Colorado  Springs
     facility or the restructuring; and any statements or assumptions underlying
     any of the  foregoing;  the extent or timing of cost  savings,  use of cost
     savings, revenue or profitability  improvements,  or other financial items;
     any statements  concerning the company's expected  competitive  position or
     performance; any statements of expectation or belief; and any statements of
     assumptions underlying any of the foregoing.  Intel presently considers the
     factors set forth below to be the important factors that could cause actual
     results to differ  materially  from the company's  published  expectations:
     risks,  uncertainties and assumptions including the timing and execution of
     plans and  programs  subject  to local  labor law  requirements,  including
     consultation  with  appropriate  works  councils;  assumptions  related  to
     severance and  post-retirement  costs; future  acquisitions,  dispositions,
     investments,  new  business  initiatives  and  changes in product  roadmap,
     development  and  manufacturing  which may affect  expense  and  employment
     levels at the  company;  assumptions  relating  to  product  demand and the
     business  environment;  and other risk factors that are described from time
     to  time in the  company's  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  reports,
     including  but not limited to the risk factors  described in the  company's
     Quarterly  Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal  quarter ended  September 30,
     2006,  and other reports  filed after the  company's  Annual Report on Form
     10-K for the fiscal year ended  December 31, 2005.  The company  assumes no
     obligation to update these forward-looking statements.

              Intel Fourth-Quarter Revenue $9.7 Billion


    --  Operating Income $1.5 Billion

    --  EPS 26 Cents

    --  Record Microprocessor and Flash Unit Sales

    --  Record Mobile and Server Microprocessor Revenue


    SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 16, 2007--Intel
Corporation today announced fourth-quarter revenue of $9.7 billion,
operating income of $1.5 billion, net income of $1.5 billion and
earnings per share (EPS) of 26 cents. Excluding the effects of
share-based compensation, the company posted operating income of $1.8
billion, net income of $1.7 billion and EPS of 30 cents.

    Fourth-quarter results included a gain from the sale of certain
assets of the company's communications and application processor
business to Marvell Technology Group partially offset by impairments,
including an impairment for the related decision to place the
company's Fab 23 facility in Colorado Springs, Colo., up for sale. The
gain and impairments resulted in a net increase to EPS of
approximately 2.5 cents. Fourth-quarter restructuring charges related
to the company's structure and efficiency program were in line with
the company's expectations and decreased EPS by approximately 1.5
cents.

    "Intel's product and technology leadership yielded a strong fourth
quarter with higher selling prices and record unit shipments in the
fastest growing segments of the market," said Intel President and CEO
Paul Otellini.

    Financial Review

    Fourth-quarter gross margin was 49.6 percent, as compared to 49.1
percent in the third quarter. Gross margin included the positive
impact of higher microprocessor units and selling prices that were
partially offset by higher factory underutilization charges along with
flash memory write-downs and NAND start-up costs. The company used
$150 million for share repurchases and announced the approval of a
12.5 percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend to 11.25 cents
per share beginning with the dividend expected to be declared in the
first quarter of 2007.

    Structure and Efficiency Review

    In September, the company announced decisions and targets
resulting from a structure and efficiency analysis. The company ended
2006 with a workforce of 94,100 people, lower than 102,500 in the
second quarter of 2006 and slightly below the target of 95,000 people.
The company is on track to generate spending and manufacturing cost
savings of approximately $2 billion in 2007 exclusive of restructuring
costs.

    Key Product Trends (Sequential)

    --  Total microprocessor units set a record. The ASP was higher,
        driven primarily by a mix shift to leading-edge processors in
        all segments along with growth in mobile as a percentage of
        the PC microprocessor mix.

    --  Chipset units were flat.

    --  Motherboard units were lower.

    --  Flash memory units set a record.

    Fourth-Quarter Sales Patterns

    Revenue was higher in all regions and greater than the seasonal
average in the Asia-Pacific and Americas regions.

        data such as megapixel-quality photos and MPEG-4 video clips.

    Business Outlook and Risk Factors Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements

    The following expectations do not include the potential impact of
any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures or other business combinations
that may be completed after Jan. 15.

    Q1 2007 Outlook

    --  Revenue: Expected to be between $8.7 billion and $9.3 billion.

    --  Gross margin: 49 percent, plus or minus a couple of points.

    --  Spending (R&D plus MG&A): Between $2.6 billion and $2.7
        billion. In addition, the company expects a first-quarter
        restructuring charge of approximately $50 million.

    --  Net gains from equity investments and interest and other:
        Approximately $130 million.

    --  Tax rate: Approximately 30 percent.

    --  Depreciation: Between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion.

    2007 Outlook

    --  Gross margin: 50 percent, plus or minus a few points.

    --  R&D: Approximately $5.4 billion.

    --  MG&A: Approximately $5.3 billion.

    --  Capital spending: $5.5 billion plus or minus $200 million. The
        forecast includes significantly higher equipment spending for
        the ramp of Intel's next-generation 45nm process technology
        that will be more than offset by savings in a variety of
        areas.

    --  Tax rate: Approximately 30 percent.

    --  Depreciation: $4.8 billion plus or minus $100 million.

    The above statements and any others in this document that refer to
plans and expectations for the first quarter, the year and the future
are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and
uncertainties. Many factors could affect Intel's actual results, and
variances from Intel's current expectations regarding such factors
could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed
in these forward-looking statements. Intel presently considers the
factors set forth below to be the important factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from the Corporation's published
expectations:

    --  Intel operates in intensely competitive industries that are
        characterized by a high percentage of costs that are fixed or
        difficult to reduce in the short term, significant pricing
        pressures, and product demand that is highly variable and
        difficult to forecast. Revenue and the gross margin percentage
        are affected by the timing of new Intel product introductions
        and the demand for and market acceptance of Intel's products;
        actions taken by Intel's competitors, including product
        offerings, marketing programs and pricing pressures and
        Intel's response to such actions; Intel's ability to respond
        quickly to technological developments and to incorporate new
        features into its products; and the availability of sufficient
        components from suppliers to meet demand. Factors that could
        cause demand to be different from Intel's expectations include
        customer acceptance of Intel and competitors' products;
        changes in customer order patterns, including order
        cancellations; changes in the level of inventory at customers;
        and changes in business and economic conditions.

    --  The gross margin percentage could vary significantly from
        expectations based on changes in revenue levels; product mix
        and pricing; capacity utilization; variations in inventory
        valuation; excess or obsolete inventory; manufacturing yields;
        changes in unit costs; impairments of long-lived assets,
        including manufacturing, assembly/test and intangible assets;
        and the timing and execution of the manufacturing ramp and
        associated costs, including start-up costs.

    --  Expenses, particularly certain marketing and compensation
        expenses, vary depending on the level of demand for Intel's
        products, the level of revenue and profits and impairments of
        long-lived assets.

    --  Intel is in the midst of a structure and efficiency program
        which is resulting in several actions that could have an
        impact on expected expense levels and gross margin.

    --  The tax rate expectation is based on current tax law and
        current expected income and assumes Intel continues to receive
        tax benefits for export sales. The tax rate may be affected by
        the closing of acquisitions or divestitures; the jurisdictions
        in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;
        changes in the estimates of credits, benefits and deductions;
        the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various
        tax authorities; and the ability to realize deferred tax
        assets.

    --  Gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other
        could vary from expectations depending on equity market levels
        and volatility; gains or losses realized on the sale or
        exchange of securities; impairment charges related to
        marketable, non-marketable and other investments; interest
        rates; cash balances; and changes in fair value of derivative
        instruments.

    --  Dividend declarations and the dividend rate are at the
        discretion of Intel's board of directors, and plans for future
        dividends may be revised by the board. Intel's dividend and
        stock buyback programs could be affected by changes in its
        capital spending programs, changes in its cash flows and
        changes in the tax laws, as well as by the level and timing of
        acquisition and investment activity.

    --  Intel's results could be affected by the amount, type, and
        valuation of share-based awards granted as well as the amount
        of awards cancelled due to employee turnover and the timing of
        award exercises by employees.

    --  Intel's results could be impacted by unexpected economic,
        social, political and physical/infrastructure conditions in
        the countries in which Intel, its customers or its suppliers
        operate, including military conflict and other security risks,
        natural disasters, infrastructure disruptions, health concerns
        and fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

    --  Intel's results could be affected by adverse effects
        associated with product defects and errata (deviations from
        published specifications), and by litigation or regulatory
        matters involving intellectual property, stockholder,
        consumer, antitrust and other issues, such as the litigation
        and regulatory matters described in Intel's SEC reports.

    A more detailed discussion of these and other factors that could
affect Intel's results is included in Intel's SEC filings, including
the report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended Sept. 30.

    Status of Business Outlook

    During the quarter, Intel's corporate representatives may
reiterate the Business Outlook during private meetings with investors,
investment analysts, the media and others. From the close of business
on March 2 until publication of the company's first-quarter 2007
earnings release, Intel will observe a "Quiet Period" during which the
Business Outlook disclosed in the company's press releases and filings
with the SEC should be considered to be historical, speaking as of
prior to the Quiet Period only and not subject to update by the
company.

   The company's operating segments currently include the Digital
    Enterprise Group, the Mobility Group, the Flash Memory Group, the
    Digital Home Group, the Digital Health Group, and the Channel
    Platforms Group. The prior period amounts have been adjusted
    retrospectively to reflect reorganizations.

   The company reports the financial results of the following
    operating segments:
   -- Digital Enterprise Group - includes microprocessors and related
    chipsets and motherboards designed for the desktop and enterprise
    computing market segments; communications infrastructure
    components such as network processors, communications boards, and
    embedded processors; wired connectivity devices; and products for
    network and server storage.
   -- Mobility Group - includes microprocessors and related chipsets
    designed for the notebook computing market segment; and wireless
    connectivity products. The operating results associated with the
    divested assets of the communications and application processor
    business were included in the Mobility Group operating segment
    through the date of the divestiture.
   -- Flash Memory Group - includes NOR flash memory products designed
    for cellular phones and embedded form factors; and NAND flash
    memory products manufactured by IMFT that are designed for memory
    cards and digital audio players.

   The Flash Memory Group, Digital Home Group, Digital Health Group
    and Channel Platforms Group operating segments do not meet the
    quantitative thresholds for reportable segments as defined by SFAS
    No. 131. However, the Flash Memory Group is reported separately,
    as management believes that this information is useful to the
    reader. The Digital Home Group, Digital Health Group and Channel
    Platforms Group operating segments are included within the "all
    other" category.

   The company has sales and marketing, manufacturing, finance, and
    administration groups. Expenses of these groups are generally
    allocated to the operating segments and are included in the
    operating results reported above. Revenue for the "all other"
    category primarily relates to microprocessors and related chipsets
    sold by the Digital Home Group. In addition to the operating
    results for the Digital Home Group, Digital Health Group, and
    Channel Platforms Group operating segments, the "all other"
    category includes certain corporate-level operating expenses,
    including a portion of profit-dependent bonus and other expenses
    not allocated to the operating segments; results of operations of
    seed businesses that support the company's initiatives;
    acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any
    impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill;
    charges for purchased in-process research and development; share-
    based compensation charges; restructuring charges; and asset
    impairment charges.


    In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),
the company's earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures
that exclude the effects of share-based compensation and the
requirements of SFAS No. 123R, "Share-based Payment" ("123R"). The
non-GAAP financial measures used by management and disclosed by the
company exclude the income statement effects of all forms of
share-based compensation and the effects of 123R upon the number of
diluted shares used in calculating non-GAAP earnings per share. The
non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the company should not be
considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures
calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results
calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those
financial statements should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP
financial measures used by the company may be calculated differently
from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled
measures used by other companies. Set forth below are reconciliations
of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable
GAAP financial measures.

    For additional information regarding these non-GAAP financial
measures, see the Form 8-K dated January 16, 2007 that Intel has filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
