      Intel Posts Record Second-Quarter Revenue of $9.2 Billion;
                     Earnings Per Share 33 Cents

    SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 19, 2005--Intel
Corporation today announced second-quarter revenue of $9.2 billion, up
15 percent year-over-year and down 2 percent sequentially.
    Second-quarter net income was $2 billion, up 16 percent
year-over-year and down 6 percent sequentially. Earnings per share
were 33 cents, up 22 percent from 27 cents in the second quarter of
2004 and down 6 percent from 35 cents in the first quarter of 2005.
    "Intel delivered record second-quarter revenue, with growth of 15
percent versus a year ago led by strong demand for our notebook
platforms," said Paul Otellini, president and CEO. "Our investments in
new products, advanced silicon capacity and emerging markets are
paying off with growth that is outpacing the industry. We look forward
to the second half of 2005 as we ramp dual-core microprocessors into
high volume, begin production on our 65nm process technology and
deliver innovative new platforms."
    Intel's results for the previous quarter included an additional
week of business because 2005 is a 53-week fiscal year for the
company. As discussed in the company's June 9 Mid-Quarter Business
Update, Intel's results for the second-quarter included a tax
adjustment primarily related to an increase in estimated research and
development credits for prior years.
    The reversal of previously accrued taxes increased second-quarter
earnings-per-share by approximately 2 cents. Intel's results for last
year's second quarter included a reversal of previously accrued taxes
that increased earnings-per-share by 1.3 cents.

    BUSINESS OUTLOOK

    The following statements are based on current expectations. These
statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ
materially. Please see the Risk Factors Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements in this release for a description of certain important risk
factors that could cause actual results to differ, and refer to
Intel's annual and quarterly reports on file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) for a more complete description of the
risks. These statements do not include the potential impact of any
mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, investments or other business
combinations that may be completed after July 18, 2005.

    --  Revenue in the third quarter is expected to be between $9.6
        billion and $10.2 billion.

    --  Gross margin percentage for the third quarter is expected to
        be approximately 60 percent, plus or minus a couple of points,
        as compared to 56.4 percent in the second quarter. The gross
        margin percentage expectation for 2005 has been narrowed from
        59 percent, plus or minus a few points, to 59 percent, plus or
        minus a couple of points. The gross margin percentage could
        vary from expectations based on changes in revenue levels,
        product mix and pricing; variations in inventory valuation,
        including variations related to the timing of qualifying
        products for sale; excess or obsolete inventory; manufacturing
        yields; changes in unit costs; capacity utilization;
        impairments of long-lived assets, including manufacturing,
        assembly/test and intangible assets; and the timing and
        execution of the manufacturing ramp and associated costs,
        including start-up costs.

    --  Expenses (R&D plus MG&A) in the third quarter are expected to
        be between $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion, higher than $2.5
        billion in the second quarter, primarily driven by increases
        in research and development. The company is transferring
        resources from 65nm start-up programs to 45nm development and
        increasing investments in new platforms. Expenses,
        particularly certain marketing and compensation expenses, vary
        depending on the level of demand for Intel's products and the
        level of revenue and profits.

    --  The R&D spending expectation for 2005 is unchanged at
        approximately $5.2 billion.

    --  The capital spending expectation for 2005 has been increased
        to approximately $5.9 billion, plus or minus $200 million, as
        compared to the previous expectation of $5.4 billion to $5.8
        billion, to support higher expected demand.

    --  Gains from equity investments and interest and other in the
        third quarter are expected to be approximately $130 million.

    --  The tax rate for the third and fourth quarters is expected to
        be approximately 30.5 percent. The tax rate expectation does
        not reflect the impact of any potential repatriation of cash
        under the American Jobs Creation Act (Jobs Act). The company
        currently expects to finalize its analysis of whether, and to
        what extent, foreign earnings might be repatriated under the
        Jobs Act in September, which would impact the third quarter
        tax rate. The tax rate expectation is based on current tax law
        and current expected income and assumes Intel continues to
        receive tax benefits for export sales. The tax rate may be
        affected by the closing of acquisitions or divestitures; the
        jurisdiction in which profits are determined to be earned and
        taxed; changes in the estimates of credits, benefits and
        deductions; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits
        with various tax authorities; and the ability to realize
        deferred tax assets.

    --  Depreciation for the third quarter is expected to be between
        $1 billion and $1.1 billion, approximately flat with the
        second quarter. Depreciation for 2005 is now expected to be
        between $4.3 billion and $4.4 billion, as compared to the
        previous expectation of $4.4 billion, plus or minus $100
        million.

    --  Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and costs is
        expected to be approximately $30 million in the third quarter.
        The full-year expectation is now approximately $120 million,
        slightly below the previous expectation of $125 million.

    SECOND-QUARTER REVIEW AND RECENT HIGHLIGHTS

    Financial Review

    --  Intel used $2.5 billion in cash to repurchase 98.9 million
        shares of its common stock during the quarter under an ongoing
        program.

    --  The company paid a cash dividend of 8 cents per share on June
        1 to stockholders of record on May 7.

    --  Gains from equity investments and interest and other in the
        second quarter were $105 million. The amount included $22
        million in net losses from equity investments driven by $133
        million in impairments, primarily due to a $105-million
        impairment of Intel's investment in Micron Technology to
        reflect the difference between the cost basis of the
        investment and the stock price at the end of the quarter. The
        impairments were partially offset by gains from dispositions.

    --  In June 2005, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service proposed
        certain adjustments related to the amounts reflected as a tax
        benefit for export sales in Intel's 2001 and 2002 tax returns.
        The company does not agree with these adjustments and is in
        the process of appealing similar adjustments with respect to
        Intel's 1999 and 2000 tax returns (see Intel's SEC filing on
        Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 2, 2005). If the IRS
        were to prevail with respect to the 2001 and 2002 proposed
        adjustments, Intel's federal income tax due for these years
        would increase by approximately $400 million, plus interest.

    Key Product Trends (Sequential)

    --  Total microprocessor units were at record levels. The average
        selling price was slightly lower primarily due to an increase
        in Xbox* processor shipments along with slightly lower
        computing processor prices.

    --  Chipset units were higher.

    --  Motherboard units were lower.

    --  Flash memory units were higher and at record levels, with
        lower average selling prices.

    --  Wireless connectivity units set a record.

    --  Wired connectivity units were lower.

    Digital Enterprise

    For business PCs, the company introduced the first Intel(R)
Professional Business Platform, which is based on the recently
introduced Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 processor with Hyper-Threading
Technology 600 sequence, the new Intel(R) 945G Express Chipset, and
the Intel(R) PRO/1000 PM network connection. The new platform brings
the company's advanced security, management and collaboration
technologies to mainstream business PCs. Enhancements include the
introduction of Intel(R) Active Management Technology (AMT), designed
to help IT managers monitor and manage all Intel AMT-enabled PCs on
their networks.
    The company introduced five new Intel(R) Celeron(R) D processors
with 64-bit computing capability for the value PC segment. Intel now
has 64-bit capability available throughout its desktop and server
microprocessor product lines.
    For servers, Intel introduced an entry-level server platform based
on the dual-core Intel Pentium D processor and the Intel(R) E7230
chipset. The first of Intel's dual-core platforms for servers, it
supports DDR2 memory, PCI Express* I/O and software RAID.
    The company also introduced two Intel(R) Itanium(R) 2 processors
with a 667 MHz front side bus. Itanium-based server bandwidth can be
increased by 65 percent using the new bus architecture, which also
supports Intel's forthcoming dual-core Itanium processor, codenamed
Montecito. A test system based on Montecito set a new 4-way
performance record of 45 gigaflops on the LINPACK floating-point
performance benchmark during the quarter, exceeding the previous
record of 27.5 gigaflops held by a RISC-based system.(1)
    According to the latest TOP500* ranking, Intel processors are used
in two-thirds of the world's fastest supercomputers. The Top500 list
now includes 254 systems based on Intel(R) Xeon(TM) and 64-bit Intel
Xeon processors and 79 systems based on Intel Itanium processors.
    In telecommunications infrastructure, Intel announced its second
generation of AdvancedTCA* (Advanced Telecom Computing Architecture)
products. The company added three new communication server blades and
related technologies that help manufacturers and service providers
more easily design and build standards-based IP Multimedia Subsystem
(IMS) equipment and services. In addition, Intel and Alcatel announced
plans to bring AdvancedTCA platforms to mobile service providers, with
Alcatel planning to deliver single-board solutions based on the
Intel(R) Pentium(R) M processor in early 2006.

    Mobility

    Intel's latest notebook PC platform based on Intel(R) Centrino(TM)
Mobile Technology has become the company's fastest-ramping mobile
platform ever, accounting for over 50 percent of performance mobile
shipments in the first full quarter after launch. Formerly codenamed
Sonoma, the platform offers greater performance and new capabilities
for consumer and business applications while maintaining long battery
life. Intel's notebook platforms continue to see strong year-over-year
growth, with double-digit increases in mobile chipsets with integrated
graphics as well as WiFi, where Intel has become the No. 1 silicon
supplier according to ABI Research.
    In next-generation wireless broadband technology, Intel announced
plans with Sprint, Huawei Technologies, Nokia and Arraycomm designed
to help advance the development, deployment and adoption of WiMAX
networks. For example, Intel and Sprint announced a collaboration to
advance WiMAX technology for high-capacity wireless broadband coverage
and services in metropolitan areas. Intel and Huawei plan to enable
carrier-grade networks using WiMAX technology. Intel and ArrayComm
announced plans to incorporate additional technologies into the IEEE
802.16 specification to support smart antenna technology that can
improve overall WiMAX network range, capacity and coverage quality.
    In flash memory, the company continued to see strong design win
momentum for its Intel(R) StrataFlash(R) memories in cellular phone
designs. The company generated ongoing growth in flash shipments to
the embedded market segment which contributed to overall flash unit
shipments being at record levels for the quarter.
    Intel's application processors for phones and consumer electronics
devices saw continued strong demand, with double-digit year-over-year
growth. A new cellular phone design based on the Intel(R) PXA800F
baseband chipset for GSM/GPRS networks was introduced during the
quarter by O2, a major European carrier. Intel's next-generation
baseband chipset for GPRS/EDGE/UMTS networks, code-named Hermon, is
scheduled to be introduced later in the year.

    Digital Home

    For home PCs, Intel introduced a desktop platform based on the new
dual-core Intel(R) Pentium(R) D processor which is designed to provide
consumers with the ability to do more with their digital content
simultaneously. The new platform includes the Intel(R) 945 Express
Chipset family which supports consumer electronics-like features such
as surround-sound audio, high-definition video and enhanced 3-D
graphics.
    Intel took a number of key steps to help accelerate the
availability of premium entertainment content in the digital home.
Intel invested in ClickStar, an online service intended to allow
consumers to view premium movies in the home. ClickStar was formed by
Revelations Entertainment, a partnership between actor Morgan Freeman
and producer Lori McCreary.
    Intel also announced a collaboration with the Yoshimoto Kogyo
talent agency of Japan and invested in Bellrock Media, its digital
content production and delivery company in the United States. Intel
invested in Mobilians, a Korean company that is developing payment
services and technologies for purchasing online content using mobile
phones.

    Technology and Manufacturing

    Intel continued the development of its forthcoming 65nm process
technology and began providing customers with samples of
microprocessors codenamed Yonah, Presler and Dempsey, the company's
first 65nm dual-core microprocessors for notebook, desktop and server
platforms, respectively. Intel's industry-leading 65nm process
technology will enable cost-effective production of dual-core
processors, with platforms ramping into high volume in 2006.
    Intel and Corning announced plans to develop photomask substrates
for Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. The substrates are needed
to develop low-defect photomasks for high-volume 32nm production using
EUV lithography tools.

    EARNINGS WEBCAST

    Intel will hold a public webcast at 2:30 p.m. PDT today on its

will be available until Oct. 18.

    STATUS OF BUSINESS OUTLOOK AND MID-QUARTER BUSINESS UPDATE

    During the quarter, Intel's corporate representatives may
reiterate the Business Outlook during private meetings with investors,
investment analysts, the media and others. Intel intends to publish a
Mid-Quarter Business Update on Sept. 8. From the close of business on
Sept. 2 until publication of the Update, Intel will observe a "Quiet
Period" during which the Business Outlook disclosed in the company's
press releases and filings with the SEC on Forms 10-K and 10-Q should
be considered to be historical, speaking as of prior to the Quiet
Period only and not subject to update by the company. For more
information about the Business Outlook, Update and related Quiet
Periods, please refer to the Business Outlook section of Intel's Web

    RISK FACTORS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

    The statements in this document that refer to plans and
expectations for the third quarter, the year and the future are
forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and
uncertainties. Many factors could affect Intel's actual results, and
variances from Intel's current expectations regarding such factors
could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed
in these forward-looking statements. Intel presently considers the
factors accompanying certain of such statements above and set forth
below to be the important factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from Intel's published expectations. A more detailed
discussion of these factors, as well as other factors that could
affect Intel's results, is contained in Intel's SEC filings, including
the report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 2, 2005.

    --  Intel operates in intensely competitive industries. Revenue
        and the gross margin percentage are affected by the demand for
        and market acceptance of Intel's products, the availability of
        sufficient inventory to meet demand, pricing pressures and
        actions taken by Intel's competitors. Factors that could cause
        demand to be different from Intel's expectations include
        changes in customer order patterns, including order
        cancellations; changes in the level of inventory at customers;
        and changes in business and economic conditions.

    --  Gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other
        could vary from expectations depending on equity market levels

    --  Intel's results could be impacted by unexpected economic,
        social and political conditions in the countries in which
        Intel, its customers or its suppliers operate, including
        security risks, possible infrastructure disruptions and
        fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

    --  Intel's results could also be affected by adverse effects
        associated with product defects and errata (deviations from
        published specifications), and by litigation or regulatory
        matters involving intellectual property, stockholder,
        consumer, antitrust and other issues, such as the litigation
        and regulatory matters described in Intel's SEC reports.

    Intel, the world's largest chip maker, is also a leading
manufacturer of computer, networking and communications products.

During the first quarter of 2005, the company reorganized its business
groups to bring all major product groups in line with the company's
strategy to design and deliver technology platforms. These new
business units include the Digital Enterprise Group, the Mobility
Group, the Digital Home Group, the Digital Health Group and the
Channel Products Group (formerly referred to as "Channel Platforms
Group"). The Digital Enterprise Group and the Mobility group are
reportable operating segments. The Digital Home Group, Digital Health
Group and Channel Products Group operating segments do not meet the
quantitative thresholds for reportable segments as defined by SFAS No.
131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information." Therefore, these operating segments are included within
the "all other" category. All prior period amounts have been adjusted
retrospectively to reflect the new organizational structure as well as
certain minor reorganizations effected through the second quarter of
2005. As a result of this platform reorganization, further changes may
occur in the future.

The Digital Enterprise Group operating segment's products include
microprocessors and related chipsets and motherboards designed for the
desktop (including consumer desktop) and enterprise computing market
segments, communications infrastructure components such as network
processors and embedded microprocessors, wired connectivity devices
and products for network and server storage. The Mobility Group
operating segment's products include microprocessors and related
chipsets designed for the mobile computing market segment, flash
memory, wireless connectivity products, application processors used in
cellular handsets and handheld computing devices, and cellular
baseband chipsets. Revenue for the "all other" category primarily
consists of microprocessors and related chipsets used in consumer
electronics devices. For further information on the business strategy
of the new operating segments, see Intel's Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for the quarter ended April 2, 2005.

In addition to the operating results for the Digital Home Group,
Digital Health Group and Channel Products Group operating segments,
the "all other" category also includes acquisition-related costs,
including amortization and any impairments of acquisition-related
intangibles and goodwill. In 2003, acquisition-related costs included
a goodwill impairment charge of $611 million for the remaining balance
related to the former Wireless Communications and Computing Group.
Additionally, "all other" includes the results of operations of seed
businesses that support the company's initiatives. Finally, "all
other" includes certain corporate-level operating expenses, including
a portion of profit-dependent bonus and other expenses not allocated
to the operating segments.
